    The sun cast a warm glow over the 73rd Crèche, illuminating the vibrant chaos of children celebrating their shared 18th birthday. The air was thick with laughter and the scent of freshly cut grass, but for Arthur, the day felt bittersweet. He stood beside the sleek silver Crèche Car, his luggage already stowed away, heart racing with anticipation for the adventure that awaited him in New Philadelphia and Zenith World.
