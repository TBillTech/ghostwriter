   - **Improvement:** None needed.

2. **Explicit: Moving Day is also the birthday of all 10000 in the cohort.**
   - **Status:** Satisfied explicitly.
   - **Improvement:** None needed.

3. **Implicit: A birthday is not as special when it is shared by 9999 other kids at the same time!**

   - **Status:** Satisfied explicitly.
   - **Improvement:** None needed.

6. **Implicit: Is logging into Zenith World really going to go as smoothly as Arthur hopes?**

    - **Improvement:** A more vivid description of his eagerness could enhance this feeling.

12. **Explicit: Misty thinks there is something afoot with Zenith World, and she is not going to let Arthur get sucked in without an objective observer present.**
    - **Status:** Satisfied explicitly.
    - **Improvement:** None needed.

13. **Implicit: What if Zenith World hides dark secrets that Misty only thinks she is ready for?**
