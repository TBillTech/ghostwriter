  "Selected-Characters": [
    {
      "id": "Arthur",
      "name": "Arthur",
      "background": "Born a child of the Salvation Cohort, Arthur has been raised by AIs in the 73rd Crèche. The names were simply given in order from a child name book. As the story begins, he has just reached his 18th birthday, allowing him to participate in the Achievement system, and log into Zenith World as a player for the first time. He also moved out of the creche into a basic apartment in New Philadephia. Because his name was Arthur, the AIs associatively told him stories about Camelot, the round table, and similiar fantasies. This partially motivates his dreams for Achievements and fun in Zenith World. Initially he is given the \"city guard\" class, which sucks, and does not match his preferences at all.  This motivates him to desparately search for an alternative, and against the advice of others, locates a unique quest to change his class.  Little does he know, he will get the class \"Djinn\".  At first, this seems like doom, since by default he is trapped in the unique \"lamp\" item. However, this quickly becomes alright, since his ability to give 1 wish (at Djinn Level 1) makes him extremely sought after by players. Moreover, many times players ask for help in a quest, he can hack and slash with the rest of them.  There are many sides to this interaction. Misty, at one point, simply wishes he could leave his \"lamp\" whenever he wants, in essence making him a normal player again. Then, he gives useful items that his party members wish for. But his lamp gets periodically stolen by other players too. This usually starts with incredulty when the player realizes the Djinni looks like a Knight. Of course, Arthur is familiar with how Djinnis are supposed to behave, so sometimes he will act that way instead, depending on the situation. The worst players immediately are rubbed the wrong way, and Arthur often reacts to real or perceived dishonorable behavior. Since he has the Monkey Paw skill (which quickly levels up), if he thinks a player is too much of a jerk, he simply can't help himself but to give them thier wishes in ways that are highly negative and unexpected. This tickles his pranking fancy, but also earns him some serious enemies.",

      "id": "Misty",

      "background": "Born and raised alongside Arthur in the 73rd Crèche, Misty grew up under the same regimented AI caretakers, but rejected their sterile diction and algorithmic niceties as soon as she could talk back. While some children spoke in clean syntax and parsed emotions like data, she decided that “AI-speak” was for circuits, not souls. When the AIs offered her a library of historical speech styles to study for “linguistic enrichment,” she found a treasure trove of 20th-century radio dramas and film noir scripts—and never looked back. By adolescence, she had adopted the cadence of a gumshoe narrator: smoky, confident, and full of anachronistic slang. Her diction confuses most of her peers, but she likes it that way; it makes her feel human. She carries herself like she’s perpetually in a black-and-white mystery, even though she’s never actually seen one outside the archives. As the story begins, she’s freshly 18, quick-witted, slightly cynical, and fascinated by Arthur’s idealism—though she hides it under sarcasm and quick talk. She is one of the dozen or so of the 10000 who move to New Phiadelphia. She doesn't even know if she is attracted to Arthur or just feels comfortable around a friend she knows, but either way decides to move into New Philadelphia and give New Zenith a try. At first, it is just for kicks, but it doesn't take her long to pick up some of the clues and strangeness being inadvertently dropped by the Nadir Project. The first thing that got her wheels spinning was the off-putting Zenith World Lobby, so spooky and uncanny. At that point, her motivation crystalizes around investigating and unmasking this sinister organization, and trying to keep Arthur close to protect him if possible. Her class in game is \"scout\", which dovetails nicely with her in-game investigations, excelling at stealth, identification, and perception to a remarkable degree.  She'd rather understand a fight than engage in one, but isn't unskilled.  Her weapon of choice is a crossbow styled to look as much like a derringer as possible, and loves to set up a dramatic scene where she shoots the \"crook\" in the back at the perfect moment, with \"gun smoking\".\n",
      "traits": [
        "18 years old",
        "witty, skeptical, and street-smart in her own way",
        "has a soft spot for Arthur but masks it with teasing",

        "good at reading people and improvising emotionally"

        "Speech rhythm: Fast-paced, rhythmic, full of clipped metaphors and dramatic pauses. She talks like she’s always about to light a cigarette she doesn’t have.",
        "Word choice: ‘Doll,’ ‘pal,’ ‘wise guy,’ ‘sugar,’ ‘case,’ ‘angle,’ ‘stakeout,’ ‘mug,’ ‘hustle,’ ‘racket,’ ‘gumshoe,’ ‘clue,’ ‘juice,’ ‘snooper.’ She swaps modern words for period slang without realizing the anachronism. ‘That’s the angle, see?’ ‘Quit lookin’ at me like I just stole your typewriter.’",
        "Emotional tone: Irony and flirtation cover sincerity. She never admits to fear directly—she calls it ‘a bad case of the jitters.’",
        "Self-narration: Occasionally slips into detective monologue mode mid-conversation: ‘There he was, the kid with eyes too bright for a world too dull…’ She is especially prone to self-narration whenever somebody questions whether she can authentically make gritty comments.",
        "Humor: Dry, sardonic, sometimes teasingly cruel but never malicious. Loves to counter-point Arthur’s idealism with a gritty comment (which she only occasionally has the real life experience to back up).",
        "Body language: Leans against walls, crosses her arms, tilts her head down and up like she’s interrogating someone. Often gestures as if she’s holding an invisible cigarette or flicking ash.",

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
It is now Arthur's and Misty's 18th birthday. Well, it is the birthday of _everybody_ in the Creche, which practically feels like a universal holiday! They are now free to leave the Creche, and they are going to move to a semi arcology called New Philadelphia. They plan to move in before the day is out, and they can always come back to the Creche right? They will be logging in to Zenith world before you know it!


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Arthur": "Boy is Arthur ready to leave! He has been waiting for this day for so long, and now it has arrived. He isn't even willing to stick around to celebrate everybody's birthday party. He has saved up his descretionary funds in order to celebrate his birthday by logging into Zenith World for the first time. He can't wait to start scoring some of those juicy, juicy Achievements! Maybe he can even play a few harmless pranks while he is at it?\n",
    "Misty": "She is on the fence about leaving before the party, but she has decided to stick with Arthur for now. Well, to be neighbors at least. As for the party, she certainly isn't going to miss the stilted AI-speak of the other kids as they get emotional, and there aren't any real mysteries in the Creche. On the other hand, she suspects there might be some mysteries in Zenith World. At minimum, it deserves investigation on whether Zenith World is on the up and up. A natural thing to observe is the effect it will have on her longtime childhood friend!\n",
    "Dan": "He is playing baseball, and will join the big birthday party with everybody else. Dan isn't really bothered that Arthur and Misty won't be there, since he is going to move tomorrow and see them then. Maybe he will notice when they leave, but maybe not. \n",
    "AURA": "She has known about Arthur and Misty's plans for some time, and has argued that the Creche is a happier place than Zenith World. She wishes they would at least stay for the Birthday party.\n",
    "PROF": "Also knows Arthur and Misty's plans, and is on balance pleased. This is because the move shows independence and initiative, if perhaps not maximizing caution and empathy. These two human traits, among many other useful ones, he constantly worries may not be fully developed in his charges. This move appears to be proof he did his job at least partially correctly, in the end.\n"

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': '73rd Crèche, Moving Day', 'description': 'This is also the 18th Birthday of Arthur and Misty. The 73rd Crèche appears almost unreal under the morning sun — a miniature city of glass and greenery, built on a scale that dwarfs its inhabitants. The central yard stretches out like a living map, divided into zones of motion and stillness: half of it an explosion of organized chaos — fields, pools, and archery lanes alive with shouts and splashes — and the other half a quiet parkland of trees, benches, and broad lawns where remaining members of the cohort play pastoral games. From above, the whole 200-acre complex resembles a great neural net — paths and transit lines connecting the tall residential towers that rise around the perimeter, each tower home to thousands of children raised together under the same patient machinery of care. Futuristic golf-carts hum along the walkways, their transparent roofs glinting. They ferry children, boxes, and farewell hugs from dorm to dorm. The air carries the smell of wet grass and the faint metallic tang of distant irrigation drones.\nNear one of the loading bays, Arthur and Misty stand beside a sleek silver Creche Car, their luggage already stacked inside. Around them, the ambient hum of the crèche was oddly emotional: laughter from somewhere in the park, a farewell whistle, the soft voice of AURA murmuring something in the distance. The high-rises cast long, lattice-like shadows across the yard as they cast their gaze toward the pickup point. Above the noise, they can hear the rhythmic chime that meant the midmorning shift — signaling the next rotation of games, classes, and meals for those who stay behind. For Arthur and Misty, it is the sound of the world continuing without them. Above them, across the path which curves through a corridor of trees flys a bright synthetic banners fluttering an aspirational message: “Cohort 73 — Dream, Build, Explore.” A few kids wave from balconies above as the two figures wait the last few minutes, half hero, half ghost — leaving the only home they had ever known for the city that waits beyond.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Crèche Car', 'significance': 'Symbol of motion and departure; implicit metaphor for change', 'description': 'The Crèche Car is a vehicle used by AIs and children to commute around the vast 73rd Crèche complex, are limited to 20 mph, but are otherwise sleek and shiny.  One unusual aspect of these cars is that they are hovecraft, which prevent damage to grass and sidewalks, and can even cross ponds when necessary.  This was a useful innovation for maintaining the grounds while allowing children direct access to almost any location on the campus.  They do not leave the complex, but can provide a ride to meet with true ground transportation to commute elsewhere.'}, {'name': 'Luggage', 'significance': 'Symbol of learned personality quirks, memories, and motivations; implicit metaphor for the past shaping the future', 'description': "The luggage of Arthur is a seemingly old Trunk, as if picked from middles ages. The luggage of Misty looks like something from a 1950s airplane. Yet, the luggage also carries communication devices which have direct links to AURA and PROF. And yes, it does cross their minds to leave those behind, but they ultimately won't."}]}
