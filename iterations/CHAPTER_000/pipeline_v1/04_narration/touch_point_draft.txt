The 73rd Crèche stood as an architectural marvel, a sprawling complex of glass and greenery that seemed to breathe with the rhythm of its young inhabitants. The central yard was a dynamic landscape, bustling with athletic activities on one side and serene with quiet games on the other, reflecting the dual nature of childhood exploration and introspection. Futuristic golf carts with transparent roofs glided silently along the pathways, a testament to the seamless integration of technology and nature within the Crèche. The ambient sounds—laughter, farewells, and the distant voice of AURA—created a tapestry of emotions underscoring the significance of the day. The rhythmic chime signaling the midmorning shift echoed through the air, a reminder of the structured life continuing for those who remained. Above the path, synthetic banners with the message "Cohort 73 — Dream, Build, Explore" fluttered, symbolizing the aspirations instilled in the children of the Crèche. The high-rises cast long shadows across the yard, emphasizing the passage of time and the impending change in Arthur and Misty's lives.

Arthur and Misty stood near a sleek silver Creche Car, their luggage already loaded, marking the beginning of their journey away from the only home they'd known. Arthur's luggage, resembling an old trunk from the Middle Ages, hinted at his fascination with stories of knights and quests. Misty's luggage, styled like something from a 1950s airplane, reflected her affinity for vintage aesthetics and her rejection of AI-speak. The Creche Car, a symbol of motion and departure, represented the transition from the sheltered life of the Crèche to the unknown world beyond. As Arthur and Misty waited by the loading bay, the world around them continued, indifferent to their departure yet charged with the weight of their decision. The farewell gestures from balconies above served as a poignant reminder of the connections formed within the Crèche, even as Arthur and Misty prepared to leave them behind.
