The 73rd Crèche appears almost unreal under the morning sun — a miniature city of glass and greenery, built on a scale that dwarfs its inhabitants. The central yard stretches out like a living map, divided into zones of motion and stillness: half of it an explosion of organized chaos — fields, pools, and archery lanes alive with shouts and splashes — and the other half a quiet parkland of trees, benches, and broad lawns where remaining members of the cohort play pastoral games. From above, the whole 200-acre complex resembles a great neural net — paths and transit lines connecting the tall residential towers that rise around the perimeter, each tower home to thousands of children raised together under the same patient machinery of care. Futuristic golf-carts hum along the walkways, their transparent roofs glinting. They ferry children, boxes, and farewell hugs from dorm to dorm. The air carries the smell of wet grass and the faint metallic tang of distant irrigation drones.\\nNear one of the loading bays, Arthur and Misty stand beside a sleek silver Creche Car, their luggage already stacked inside. Around them, the ambient hum of the crèche was oddly emotional: laughter from somewhere in the park, a farewell whistle, the soft voice of AURA murmuring something in the distance. The high-rises cast long, lattice-like shadows across the yard as they cast their gaze toward the pickup point. Above the noise, they can hear the rhythmic chime that meant the midmorning shift — signaling the next rotation of games, classes, and meals for those who stay behind. For Arthur and Misty, it is the sound of the world continuing without them. Above them, across the path which curves through a corridor of trees flys a bright synthetic banners fluttering an aspirational message: “Cohort 73 — Dream, Build, Explore.” A few kids wave from balconies above as the two figures wait the last few minutes, half hero, half ghost — leaving the only home they had ever known for the city that waits beyond.\\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Crèche Car', 'significance': 'Symbol of motion and departure; implicit metaphor for change', 'description': 'The Crèche Car is a vehicle used by AIs and children to commute around the vast 73rd Crèche complex, are limited to 20 mph, but are otherwise sleek and shiny.  One unusual aspect of these cars is that they are hovecraft, which prevent damage to grass and sidewalks, and can even cross ponds when necessary.
