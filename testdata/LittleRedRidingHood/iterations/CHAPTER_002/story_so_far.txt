Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Inside, where thyme and cabbage sighed and Grandmother's clock ticked small and thin, he measured time by chimney smoke and the warm heat of the latch, tested the shape of his lies at the door, and let a soft, practiced knock fall like a coin into quiet. The house answered with a creak and a hesitant lift; the kettle sighed, curtains stirred, and in a single, smooth motion he sprang, swallowed the old woman whole, then set himself to tucking the room into the semblance of sleep: he steadied the chair, soothed the quilt, nudged the teapot back to a whisper, powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, practiced a smaller smile and a cough, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting so that when Red's step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with warm, measured voice and a doorway softened by the pretense of kin.
