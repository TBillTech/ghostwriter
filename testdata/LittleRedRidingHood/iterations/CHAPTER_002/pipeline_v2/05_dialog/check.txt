You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

One thing to watch out for is that these actors have tendency to repeat themselves.  If you notice this, point out where some text is redundant and should be removed. The audience won't like hearing the same thing over and over. 

Also watch out for the wrong balance of Narration. A few sentences where needed are OK to paint the picture, but this should be dialog not long prose.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning and Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door; no footfall, no Red yet. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath.

He rested a paw in the warm earth, shaking pine needles from his coat. Warm smoke rose from Grandmother's chimney. He measured the sun on the shingles—time enough before Red could reach the cottage. He scanned hedge and path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter. He studied Grandmother's iron latch, which glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. "Such a charming hood," he murmured to himself, testing the shape of the lie, and padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room's tiny sounds.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Wolf, Grandmother

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should at some point directly address the following touch-point:
Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."


# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
The Wolf let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin.
Wolf mimicked Red, speaking softly, "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother voice came from within, muffled with age, "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."
A faint creak answered.

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Replace opening sentence with a tighter action that fits the Wolf’s calibrated charm. Remove: "The Wolf let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin." Add/replace with: He tapped—three polite, practiced knocks—each measured to sound like a child at the door.

- Smooth the Wolf’s mimicry to show sly theater and breathy tone while avoiding a stagey simile. Replace: Wolf mimicked Red, speaking softly, "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?" With: The Wolf softened, breathing the lines like a lullaby. "Grandmother—it's me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

- Fix Grandmother tag wording and make muffled quality part of the tag. Replace: Grandmother voice came from within, muffled with age, "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting." With: A muffled voice from within—Grandmother's, thin as old cloth—said, "Lift the latch, child. I've been waiting."

- Remove the redundant/flat final line. Delete: "A faint creak answered." Replace with a single, specific sound tied to the latch so the moment is clear but lean: The latch clicked.

- Optional micro-add after the latch clicks (one short beat) to keep Wolf’s mannerism alive: add a single brief reaction from the Wolf (no long narration). Suggested line: The Wolf let a low, pleased chuckle ride the sound.
