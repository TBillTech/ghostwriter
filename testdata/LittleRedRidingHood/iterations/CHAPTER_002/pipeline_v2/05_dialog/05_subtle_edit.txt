You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Once inside he turned domesticity into disguise: he swallowed Grandmother whole in a single, terrible motion, smoothed the room as if sewing a silence—steadying the chair, coaxing the teapot back to whisper, tucking the quilt, fastening shutters—and donned shawl, cap, spectacles and a practiced cough until the bed looked inhabited by a sleep rather than a crime. He settled beneath the strawberry quilt, powdered his muzzle, shaped a smaller smile in the glass, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting; when Red’s step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with a warm, measured voice and a doorstep softened by the pretense of kin.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines—and when I chose the narrow deer-track I walked faster, thinking of Grandmother waiting with bread and jam. The wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edges of my mind as I hurry, but my steps carry me toward the lane and the cottage where mint and smoke will warm the kettle. I had not seen what followed the latch: the quiet that answered his polite knock, the way the door sighed open to warm air and the scent of herbs, nor how the room changed—how chairs tipped, the teapot trembled, the quilt shuddered—only that the cottage would be ready, safe, because I must have been expected. I approach with my hood bright against the pines, clutching the wicker, humming the tune, crossing the verge of blue flowers and the crooked stump’s shadow, still certain my coming will bring the soft, familiar voice I remember, and not yet knowing the hush that waits behind the shuttered light.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, and when I reached the cottage the sun on the shingles counted out the hours I would take. I tested the latch with a practiced knock, smoothed my voice into a smaller, kinlier tone, and let the door open to warm mint and wood smoke; the room inhaled me and I answered in motion. One swift, private movement closed the distance between hunger and finish—Grandmother gone, the teapot sighing in the wake—and then the work began: righting a tipped chair, nudging the saucer true, poking the hearth until steam resumed its curl, flattening the quilt, fastening the shutters to dim the day. I fitted the nightcap and spectacles, powdered my muzzle, practiced a softer smile and a cough, and laid myself beneath the strawberry quilt like a worn story; the cottage folded itself around the pretense, the clock’s tick marking a measured patience as I set my voice to welcome, tipped a slippered paw to the step, and waited for her bright hood and small song to bring the last piece of the play.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf slip from my bramble into thyme and cabbage, drawn by the scent of jam that rides my air. He checked the lane and the quiet, counted the sun on the shingles as if it were a reckoning, and where the cottage door breathed warm mint and ash I held my breath as the room altered—the latch lifting, a chair tipping, the quilt shuddering—then stilling into a new hush. I felt the small domestic storm settle as he smoothed powder along his muzzle, tugged the nightcap, drew the shutters and muffled the light until the cottage became a dim little theater; the teapot resumed its soft pulse, the clock’s tick grew a careful metronome, and the path folded the moment into my long quiet, keeping the trail and the hush side by side until her steps would meet the door.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
He knocked once.

"Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Grandmother (muffled): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace the blunt opener "He knocked once." with a short, characterful beat that shows the Wolf’s performative cunning and avoids narrating action the character would describe. Example to insert: The Wolf let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin. (Keep it one sentence only.)

- Keep the Wolf’s required line verbatim but move the parenthetical into a compact speaker tag to preserve cadence and stage direction: Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?" — ensure the line follows immediately after the single knock.

- Tidy the Grandmother tag to the required muffled-with-age direction but make her voice warm and homey while keeping the exact wording: Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting." — place this immediately after the Wolf’s line with no extra narration between.

- Remove any extra narration or sensory detail between the two lines (no description of ears, latches, or external sounds) so the exchange reads as a tight call-and-response and stays focused on dialog.

- Adjust punctuation and formatting so each speaker’s attribution is on its own line and the quoted speech follows directly (no extra blank lines or stage directions breaking flow).

- Optional polish (if you want a tiny mood cue): add one brief ambient beat after Grandmother’s reply — a faint creak or the scrape of a latch — but only as a single short sentence and only after both lines, to preserve momentum.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.

=== RESPONSE ===
The Wolf let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin.
Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."
A faint creak answered.
