Wolf paused, paw brushing the doorframe. The latch clicked; the kettle sighed as if nothing were odd, and warm air—mint and ash—spilled from the doorway. The moment held, equal parts invitation and caution.

Wolf's whiskers twitched. "So cosy—your cottage smells of the best things. Shall I shut the door for you?" He let the pause count; no other footfall answered the lane.

Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Mind the latch, dear—there's a little chill today; warm yourself by the fire."

The floorboards creaked under new weight.
