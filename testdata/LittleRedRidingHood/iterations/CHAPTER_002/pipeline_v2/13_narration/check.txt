You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Wolf righted and stilled the toppled chair with a careful lift. He nudged the saucer true, drew the teapot toward the heat, and nudged the embers until a red seam opened and warmed the air; a faint thread of steam resumed its curl. Wolf flattened the feather quilt and smoothed the stitched pattern, then drew the bed curtains a hand’s width tighter so the hem softened the bed’s outline.

Wolf fastened the shutter hook; daylight thinned to a gray hush and the room deepened into a private, dimmed theater. Domestic sounds folded into the dim—the kettle’s murmur and the clink of china. Wolf dabbed powder from the tin to dull any fresh gleam, tugged Grandmother’s nightcap down and smoothed the blue ribbon into a neat square, tilted the spectacles, and folded the shawl about his shoulders.

Before the dim mirror, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove.

---

The shutter hooked; pewter light thinned and a faint tune died on the sill; boards creaked softly as shadows gathered.

Wolf purred, spectacles crooked. "Come in, dear heart—mind the step." He tipped a slippered paw toward the doorway, velvet and deliberate, and tried on a cough like a glove.

"Oh, what a day you must have had." His voice rose, silk and concern.

His fingers smoothed the shawl; a claw adjusted the spectacles to blur his eyes.

"Sit. Rest—Grandmother will be so grateful if you're prompt."

He settled deeper into the quilt, small smile practiced into the fold. A tail twitched beneath the bedskirt; the corner of his mouth sharpened into a taught smile.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
A faint thread of humming drifts through the garden—the tune Red kept on the path—then fades as the wind shifts.
The Wolf’s ears lift under the nightcap. He smiles with care, and waits.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
Dust shivers in a bar of light that escaped the shutters; the clock’s tick grows loud enough to measure nerves.
From far off, a rhythm of axe on wood answers the kettle’s breath, iron and sap interlacing on the air.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Dust trembled in a narrow bar of light that slipped past the hooked shutters. The teapot breathed in soft pulses; its lid quivered against the rim. From far off, axe strokes answered the kettle’s breath in a measured rhythm, iron and sap in the air.

Wolf lay propped beneath the strawberry quilt, the bed curtains drawn to a private, dimmed hush. Wolf dabbed powder along the muzzle to soften the snout's line, smoothed the feather quilt and tucked the edge to blur his outline. Wolf's tail tucked beneath the bedskirt; the mantel clock’s tick grew loud enough to measure nerves, and its fringe lifted once at the tick, then fell.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Change "Dust trembled" to "Dust shivered" to align more precisely with the touch-point wording and sharpen rhythm.

- Replace the repeated sentence openings that all begin with "Wolf" (lines 2–4) with a mix of constructions to avoid staccato repetition. Example: keep one full "Wolf…" sentence, then use "he" or an action-first clause for the next one.

- Remove the redundant image of smoothing the quilt twice. Keep the stronger, more specific gesture (suggest keeping "smoothed the feather quilt and tucked the edge to blur his outline") and delete the earlier "laid propped beneath the strawberry quilt" phrasing that repeats bedding detail.

- Clarify the ambiguous phrase "its fringe lifted once at the tick, then fell." Identify what "fringe" refers to (clock pendulum, a tassel, or a shadow). Replace with a concrete image—e.g., "the pendulum's sway caught a sliver of light once, then fell" or "a tassel on the clock bobbed once at the tick, then stilled."

- Tighten the teapot image for stronger sensory pairing with the axe rhythm: make the sentence more parallel—e.g., "The teapot breathed; its lid quivered against the rim. From far off, axe strokes answered the kettle's breath, iron and sap threaded through the air." (This keeps the kettle/axe counterpoint but avoids awkward modifiers.)

- Slightly amplify the clock's presence to match "the clock’s tick grows loud enough to measure nerves" (touch-point). Either: lengthen "the mantel clock’s tick grew loud enough to measure nerves" with a small sensory afterthought ("so loud the floor seemed to hold its breath") or rework to active present tense to heighten immediacy ("the mantel clock's tick measured the room's nerves").

- Replace "muzzle" if you worry about humanizing Grandmother too quickly; if the Wolf is clearly in disguise, keep "muzzle" but consider "the line of his snout" or "the curve of his muzzle" for smoother cadence and to preserve voice.

- Consider inserting one small motion that ties the axe rhythm to the room's atmosphere (no explicit foreshadowing): e.g., "the rhythm of the axe threaded into the kettle's breath and the silent stitching of curtains" — brief, suggestive, and atmospheric without revealing the forbidden foreshadowing items.

- After edits, run a single pass to ensure pronouns remain unambiguous (use "he" only where context makes it unmistakable that it refers to the Wolf).
