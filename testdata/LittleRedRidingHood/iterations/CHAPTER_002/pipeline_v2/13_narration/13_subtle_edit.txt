You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Once inside he turned domesticity into disguise: he swallowed Grandmother whole in a single, terrible motion, smoothed the room as if sewing a silence—steadying the chair, coaxing the teapot back to whisper, tucking the quilt, fastening shutters—and donned shawl, cap, spectacles and a practiced cough until the bed looked inhabited by a sleep rather than a crime. He settled beneath the strawberry quilt, powdered his muzzle, shaped a smaller smile in the glass, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting; when Red’s step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with a warm, measured voice and a doorstep softened by the pretense of kin.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines—and when I chose the narrow deer-track I walked faster, thinking of Grandmother waiting with bread and jam. The wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edges of my mind as I hurry, but my steps carry me toward the lane and the cottage where mint and smoke will warm the kettle. I had not seen what followed the latch: the quiet that answered his polite knock, the way the door sighed open to warm air and the scent of herbs, nor how the room changed—how chairs tipped, the teapot trembled, the quilt shuddered—only that the cottage would be ready, safe, because I must have been expected. I approach with my hood bright against the pines, clutching the wicker, humming the tune, crossing the verge of blue flowers and the crooked stump’s shadow, still certain my coming will bring the soft, familiar voice I remember, and not yet knowing the hush that waits behind the shuttered light.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, and when I reached the cottage the sun on the shingles counted out the hours I would take. I tested the latch with a practiced knock, smoothed my voice into a smaller, kinlier tone, and let the door open to warm mint and wood smoke; the room inhaled me and I answered in motion. One swift, private movement closed the distance between hunger and finish—Grandmother gone, the teapot sighing in the wake—and then the work began: righting a tipped chair, nudging the saucer true, poking the hearth until steam resumed its curl, flattening the quilt, fastening the shutters to dim the day. I fitted the nightcap and spectacles, powdered my muzzle, practiced a softer smile and a cough, and laid myself beneath the strawberry quilt like a worn story; the cottage folded itself around the pretense, the clock’s tick marking a measured patience as I set my voice to welcome, tipped a slippered paw to the step, and waited for her bright hood and small song to bring the last piece of the play.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf slip from my bramble into thyme and cabbage, drawn by the scent of jam that rides my air. He checked the lane and the quiet, counted the sun on the shingles as if it were a reckoning, and where the cottage door breathed warm mint and ash I held my breath as the room altered—the latch lifting, a chair tipping, the quilt shuddering—then stilling into a new hush. I felt the small domestic storm settle as he smoothed powder along his muzzle, tugged the nightcap, drew the shutters and muffled the light until the cottage became a dim little theater; the teapot resumed its soft pulse, the clock’s tick grew a careful metronome, and the path folded the moment into my long quiet, keeping the trail and the hush side by side until her steps would meet the door.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
Dust shivers in a bar of light that escaped the shutters; the clock’s tick grows loud enough to measure nerves.
From far off, a rhythm of axe on wood answers the kettle’s breath, iron and sap interlacing on the air.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Dust trembled in a narrow bar of light that slipped past the hooked shutters, and the mantel clock’s tick grew loud enough to measure nerves. The teapot breathed in soft pulses; the teapot’s lid quivered, kissing the rim. From far off, axe strokes answered the kettle’s breath in a measured rhythm, sap and iron in the air.

Wolf lay propped beneath the strawberry quilt, the bed curtains drawn to a half-theater hush. He patted a dab from the powder tin across the muzzle to soften the snout’s line. He smoothed the feather quilt and tucked its edge to blur the outline beneath, and his tail hid quiet under the bedskirt; the fringe lifted once with the clock’s tick, then settled.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace the repeated phrasing "The teapot breathed in soft pulses; the teapot’s lid quivered" with a single, tighter image (e.g., "The teapot breathed in soft pulses; its lid quivered against the rim") to remove redundancy and sharpen rhythm.

- Swap "sap and iron in the air" to "iron and sap in the air" so the olfactory image matches the touch-point's intended coupling and cadence.

- Start the second paragraph with "Wolf" instead of "He" at least once (e.g., "Wolf lay propped beneath the strawberry quilt...") to avoid any momentary pronoun ambiguity and keep narration anchored to the character.

- Change "He patted a dab from the powder tin across the muzzle to soften the snout’s line" to a clearer, more idiomatic action (e.g., "Wolf dabbed powder along the muzzle to soften the snout's line") to tighten voice and remove the awkward "patted a dab."

- Tighten "the bed curtains drawn to a half-theater hush" to something slightly more immediate and consistent with prior touch-points (e.g., "the bed curtains drawn to a private, dimmed hush" or "a half-dimmed hush") to preserve the author's unusual phrasing while avoiding an image that jars.

- Make the clock tactilely present earlier in the paragraph: move or emphasize "the mantel clock’s tick grew loud enough to measure nerves" so it cues the tail-twitch and the room's tempo more directly (for example, place that sentence immediately before "the fringe lifted once with the clock’s tick, then settled").

- Replace "his tail hid quiet under the bedskirt; the fringe lifted once with the clock’s tick, then settled" with a slightly more precise gesture (e.g., "Wolf's tail tucked beneath the bedskirt; its fringe lifted once at the clock's tick, then fell") so the subject remains explicit and the physical reaction reads cleanly.

- Consider swapping "tucked its edge to blur the outline beneath" for a tighter verb (e.g., "tucked the edge to blur his outline") to reduce passivity and keep the sentence rhythm lean.

- Remove any phrasing that could verge on the forbidden foreshadowing items (avoid mentioning humming, the path tune, or ears lifting) — these are not present now, but double-check future sentences to keep that omission consistent.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.
