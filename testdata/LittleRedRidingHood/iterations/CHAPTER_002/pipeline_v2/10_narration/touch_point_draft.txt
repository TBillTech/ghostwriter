Wolf righted and stilled the toppled chair with a careful lift. He nudged the saucer true, drew the teapot toward the heat, and nudged the embers until a red seam opened and warmed the air; a faint thread of steam resumed its curl. Wolf flattened the feather quilt and smoothed the stitched pattern, then drew the bed curtains a hand’s width tighter so the hem softened the bed’s outline.

Wolf fastened the shutter hook; daylight thinned to a gray hush and the room deepened into a private, dimmed theater. Domestic sounds folded into the dim—the kettle’s murmur and the clink of china. Wolf dabbed powder from the tin to dull any fresh gleam, tugged Grandmother’s nightcap down and smoothed the blue ribbon into a neat square, tilted the spectacles, and folded the shawl about his shoulders.

Before the dim mirror, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove.
