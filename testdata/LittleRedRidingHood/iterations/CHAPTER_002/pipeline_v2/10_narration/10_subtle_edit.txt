You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Once inside he turned domesticity into disguise: he swallowed Grandmother whole in a single, terrible motion, smoothed the room as if sewing a silence—steadying the chair, coaxing the teapot back to whisper, tucking the quilt, fastening shutters—and donned shawl, cap, spectacles and a practiced cough until the bed looked inhabited by a sleep rather than a crime. He settled beneath the strawberry quilt, powdered his muzzle, shaped a smaller smile in the glass, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting; when Red’s step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with a warm, measured voice and a doorstep softened by the pretense of kin.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines—and when I chose the narrow deer-track I walked faster, thinking of Grandmother waiting with bread and jam. The wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edges of my mind as I hurry, but my steps carry me toward the lane and the cottage where mint and smoke will warm the kettle. I had not seen what followed the latch: the quiet that answered his polite knock, the way the door sighed open to warm air and the scent of herbs, nor how the room changed—how chairs tipped, the teapot trembled, the quilt shuddered—only that the cottage would be ready, safe, because I must have been expected. I approach with my hood bright against the pines, clutching the wicker, humming the tune, crossing the verge of blue flowers and the crooked stump’s shadow, still certain my coming will bring the soft, familiar voice I remember, and not yet knowing the hush that waits behind the shuttered light.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, and when I reached the cottage the sun on the shingles counted out the hours I would take. I tested the latch with a practiced knock, smoothed my voice into a smaller, kinlier tone, and let the door open to warm mint and wood smoke; the room inhaled me and I answered in motion. One swift, private movement closed the distance between hunger and finish—Grandmother gone, the teapot sighing in the wake—and then the work began: righting a tipped chair, nudging the saucer true, poking the hearth until steam resumed its curl, flattening the quilt, fastening the shutters to dim the day. I fitted the nightcap and spectacles, powdered my muzzle, practiced a softer smile and a cough, and laid myself beneath the strawberry quilt like a worn story; the cottage folded itself around the pretense, the clock’s tick marking a measured patience as I set my voice to welcome, tipped a slippered paw to the step, and waited for her bright hood and small song to bring the last piece of the play.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf slip from my bramble into thyme and cabbage, drawn by the scent of jam that rides my air. He checked the lane and the quiet, counted the sun on the shingles as if it were a reckoning, and where the cottage door breathed warm mint and ash I held my breath as the room altered—the latch lifting, a chair tipping, the quilt shuddering—then stilling into a new hush. I felt the small domestic storm settle as he smoothed powder along his muzzle, tugged the nightcap, drew the shutters and muffled the light until the cottage became a dim little theater; the teapot resumed its soft pulse, the clock’s tick grew a careful metronome, and the path folded the moment into my long quiet, keeping the trail and the hush side by side until her steps would meet the door.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
He tidies the impression of struggle to nothing, sets the kettle to murmur, and folds the shawl around his shoulders.
In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learns a smaller smile. He tries on a cough the way one tries on a glove.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Wolf righted-and-stilled the toppled chair with a careful lift so the room forgot the lurch. He nudged the saucer true, drew the teapot toward the heat and poked the hearth until a red seam opened and warmed the air; a faint thread of steam resumed its curl. Wolf flattened the feather quilt where it had heaved, smoothing the strawberry stitches until the puff looked mended, and drew the bed curtains a hand’s width tighter so the hem swallowed awkward edges and softened the bed’s shape.

Wolf found the shutter hook and fastened it into its eye; daylight thinned to a gray hush and the room deepened into a private, dimmed theater. Small domestic noises folded into the dim as if rehearsed: the kettle’s murmur, the quiet clink of china, the hush of curtains settling. Wolf dabbed powder from the tin along the muzzle to dull any fresh gleam, tugged Grandmother’s nightcap down to cover the pinched ears, smoothing the blue ribbon square. He tilted the spectacles to blur his eyes behind glass and folded the shawl around his shoulders.

In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove the hyphenation in the opening phrase; change "Wolf righted-and-stilled" to "Wolf righted and stilled" for smoother cadence.

- Trim redundancy in the first sentence: delete "so the room forgot the lurch." Instead let the precise actions carry the effect (e.g., end sentence after "stilled").

- Replace "poked the hearth until a red seam opened" with a firmer verb that suits the Wolf's practiced domesticity—suggest "stoked" or "nudged the embers until a red seam opened"—to avoid a clumsy image.

- Shorten the list of small repairs into two tight clauses to keep momentum. Example: collapse "flattened the feather quilt... smoothing the strawberry stitches until the puff looked mended, and drew the bed curtains..." into "flattened the feather quilt and smoothed the stitches, then drew the curtains a hand’s width tighter" (keeps voice but reduces stacking).

- Remove "so the hem swallowed awkward edges and softened the bed’s shape" (wordy metaphor). If you want the softening image, compress: "so the hem softened the bed’s outline."

- Change "Wolf found the shutter hook and fastened it into its eye" to "Wolf fastened the shutter hook" — cut the anthropomorphic "its eye" which slightly confuses focus and slows the sentence.

- Reduce repetition around domestic sounds: pick either "the kettle’s murmur" or "the kettle murmured." Keep one vivid auditory image; delete the extra phrasing "Small domestic noises folded into the dim as if rehearsed: the kettle’s murmur, the quiet clink of china, the hush of curtains settling." For example: "Domestic sounds folded into the dim—the kettle’s murmur, the clink of china."

- Tighten the grooming sequence for clarity and menace: reorder to foreground the deliberate concealment (powder, nightcap, spectacles, shawl). Make each action a short verb phrase: "He dabbed powder, tugged the nightcap down, tilted the spectacles, and folded the shawl about his shoulders." This emphasizes intentional performance.

- Replace "to dull any fresh gleam" with "to dull any fresh gleam of blood" only if you intend to allude overtly; otherwise keep it ambiguous: "to dull any fresh gleam" is fine but consider "to dull any fresh shine" if you want less literalness.

- Remove the passive "the blue ribbon square" — make it active and specific: "smoothing the blue ribbon into a neat square."

- Make the final two sentences stand even more stark and theatrical by placing them flush and slightly varied in rhythm. Consider adding a brief sensory anchor before the mirror line (a single-word image like "mirror" or "glass"): e.g., "Before the dim mirror, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove." (Keep exactly the touch-point phrasing but ensure it follows the tightened grooming sentence.)

- Check pronoun clarity: where you use "he" in successive sentences, consider repeating "Wolf" once or twice in the paragraph to avoid any momentary ambiguity and to preserve the persona.

- Tone consistency: preserve the Wolf's theatrical, patient cadence—avoid pastoral or overly cozy diction ("strawberry stitches," "puff looked mended") that leans too domestic; replace with slightly tauter images to match the Wolf's sinister composure (e.g., "stitched pattern" instead of "strawberry stitches").

- Final pass: read aloud to maintain the Wolf's smooth, persuasive cadence—shorten or split any sentence that trips on too many domestic details so the closing mirror/cough lines land with the intended quiet menace.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.
