You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Wolf, Grandmother

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock.
He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning and Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door; no footfall, no Red yet. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath.

He rested a paw in the warm earth, shaking pine needles from his coat. Warm smoke rose from Grandmother's chimney. He measured the sun on the shingles—time enough before Red could reach the cottage. He scanned hedge and path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter. He studied Grandmother's iron latch, which glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. "Such a charming hood," he murmured to himself, testing the shape of the lie, and padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room's tiny sounds.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Reorder to match touch-point chronology: start with the Wolf listening in the garden, then state that he smooths his voice, then show him padding to the door. (e.g., move “He smoothed his voice…” immediately after the sentence about bees and the clock, before actions like resting a paw or measuring the sun.)

- Tighten the opening sentence; remove or compress redundant sensory phrases so the listening moment reads sharper. Keep “bees droning and Grandmother’s clock ticking” and “no Red yet,” but trim extra modifiers (“hold him in its slow, sunlit breath”) or shorten them.

- Remove or reduce small distracting details that pull attention from the touch-point timing (e.g., “shaking pine needles from his coat” and/or “Warm smoke rose from Grandmother’s chimney”) or shift them later so they don’t interrupt the listen → smooth voice → pad-to-door sequence.

- Clarify location of “the room’s tiny sounds” to avoid a vague pronoun—specify “Grandmother’s room” or “inside the cottage” so the referent is unambiguous.

- Replace or sharpen “murmured to himself, testing the shape of the lie” with a line that better conveys the Wolf’s theatrical, honeyed cadence. Either give a brief example of his sly phrasing (in his established voice) or rephrase to emphasize deliberate practice of charm (e.g., “He tested the lie on his tongue—soft, obliging—then padded to the doorstep.”).

- Keep the Wolf’s surveillance detail (scanning for hounds/hunters) but compress into one crisp sentence so it supports his caution without breaking the flow: (“He scanned hedge and path—no hound, no hunter—and felt time enough.”)

- Consider ending the paragraph with the actual physical action of padding to the door as the final image (so the touch-point’s “pads to the door” has weight). Remove any subsequent small actions after that which dilute the final beat.
