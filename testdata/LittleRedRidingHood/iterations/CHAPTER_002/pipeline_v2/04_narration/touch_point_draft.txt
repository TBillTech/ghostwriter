Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning and Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door; no footfall, no Red yet. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath.

He rested a paw in the warm earth, shaking pine needles from his coat. Warm smoke rose from Grandmother's chimney. He measured the sun on the shingles—time enough before Red could reach the cottage. He scanned hedge and path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter. He studied Grandmother's iron latch, which glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. "Such a charming hood," he murmured to himself, testing the shape of the lie, and padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room's tiny sounds.
