You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Wolf paused, paw brushing the doorframe. The latch clicked; the kettle sighed as if nothing were odd, and warm air—mint and ash—spilled from the doorway. The moment held, equal parts invitation and caution.

Wolf's whiskers twitched. "So cosy—your cottage smells of the best things. Shall I shut the door for you?" He let the pause count; no other footfall answered the lane.

Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Mind the latch, dear—there's a little chill today; warm yourself by the fire."

The floorboards creaked under new weight.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
Wolf enters, then swallows Grandma up in one bite. His belly is distended, but Wolf doesn't mind.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
The latch clicked; warm mint and ash breathed from the room. The chair tipped and clattered; the cup rattled in its saucer. The feather quilt shuddered with a rush of air. Curtains stirred and then stilled, and the cottage convulsed in a small, domestic tumble—Grandmother's world set into motion and then arrested.

The Wolf stepped forward in a single, smooth bound and found the middle of the floor. A startled breath escaped Grandmother. He opened wide—jaws snapping closed—and swallowed Grandmother whole in one smooth bite. The teapot gave a small sigh; hush settled.

The Wolf's belly rounded, firm and high; the floorboards groaned under the new heft as the Wolf tested his balance, rolled his shoulders once, puffed a theatrical dusting of powder across his muzzle, perched the nightcap, nudged the spectacles, and folded his ears until his silhouette softened into something grandmotherly—pleasing work, patient as hunger. A slow, satisfied ripple moved along his flank; he tipped his head in a small, contented tilt. "There now," he murmured in a silkier, kinlier lilt, "come in, little one."

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
1. Replace ambiguous pronouns with names where clarity matters (e.g., “He opened wide…” → “The Wolf opened wide…”; “he tested his balance…” → “The Wolf tested his balance…”).

2. Tighten the opening sentence cluster to reduce repetition of sound imagery (choose two strongest sensory beats — latch/mint or chair/clatter — and cut the least necessary).

3. Make Grandmother’s physical presence clearer before the bite (briefly note her position—sitting in the chair or by the hearth) so her startled breath reads as coming from a known place.

4. Recast “jawssnapping closed” to a more rhythmic, persona-fitting phrase that preserves menace but stays measured (e.g., “The Wolf snapped his jaws and swallowed Grandmother whole in a single, smooth bite”).

5. Change “folded his ears” (unclear action) to a clearer, more animal-but-disguised motion (e.g., “tucked his ears beneath the nightcap” or “pinned his ears under the nightcap”).

6. Trim or revise the “puffed a theatrical dusting of powder across his muzzle” line if it reads anachronistic or too comic — consider a subtler grooming gesture that fits his theatrical cunning (a soft paw-press, a powdered pat).

7. Replace “pleasing work, patient as hunger” with a sharper, wolf-voiced image that keeps the writer’s flair but tightens meaning (e.g., “delightful as a well-set snare, patient as hunger”).

8. Make the Wolf’s spoken line match his established cadence—drop any adverbs describing the voice and let the line carry tone; consider adjusting to “There now — come in, little one” with a sly pause for theatricality.

9. Remove or soften the small domestic after-sounds that suggest scene-reset (e.g., “The teapot gave a small sigh; hush settled”) if they undercut the finality of the swallowing; keep one sound cue at most to preserve tone.

10. Consider varying sentence length in the paragraph describing the Wolf’s transformation (one or two short sentences amid longer ones) to mirror his controlled, theatrical movements and keep reader engagement.
