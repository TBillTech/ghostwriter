Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning, warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney. He pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat. Nettle and wood smoke rose from Grandmother's kettle. Wolf listened toward the lane: no footfall, no Red yet, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door.

Wolf measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage. Wolf checked the hedge and the path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter, no neighbor. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath. He padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room’s tiny sounds, and studied the thumb-worn latch; the iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. Behind closed teeth he rehearsed the cadence he would wear.

He knocked once.

"Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Grandmother (muffled): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."

The latch clicked. Somewhere inside, the kettle sighed. Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway; the moment held, equal parts invitation and caution.

Wolf paused, whiskers twitching. "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?"

Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold."

The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known, and the room altered its breath to meet it. Mint-scented air held an unasked question.

The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room. The chair tipped and clattered; the cup rattled in its saucer. The feather quilt shuddered with a rush of air. Curtains stirred and then stilled, and the cottage convulsed in a small, domestic tumble—Grandmother's world set into motion and then arrested.

The Wolf stepped forward in a single, smooth bound that found the middle of the floor. A startled breath escaped Grandmother. The Wolf opened wide with a swift upward tilt and swallowed Grandmother whole in one smooth bite. The teapot sighed, and a hush filled the room.

The Wolf's belly rounded, firm and high; the floorboards groaned under the new heft as the Wolf tested his balance, rolled his shoulders once, smoothed powder across his muzzle, and arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened—pleasing work, patient as hunger.

Wolf righted-and-stilled the toppled chair with a careful lift so the room forgot the lurch. He nudged the saucer true, drew the teapot toward the heat and poked the hearth until a red seam opened and warmed the air; a faint thread of steam resumed its curl. Wolf flattened the feather quilt where it had heaved, smoothing the strawberry stitches until the puff looked mended, and drew the bed curtains a hand’s width tighter so the hem swallowed awkward edges and softened the bed’s shape.

Wolf found the shutter hook and fastened it into its eye; daylight thinned to a gray hush and the room deepened into a private, dimmed theater. Small domestic noises folded into the dim as if rehearsed: the kettle’s murmur, the quiet clink of china, the hush of curtains settling. Wolf dabbed powder from the tin along the muzzle to dull any fresh gleam, tugged Grandmother’s nightcap down to cover the pinched ears, smoothing the blue ribbon square. He tilted the spectacles to blur his eyes behind glass and folded the shawl around his shoulders.

In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove.

Pewter light thins as the shutter hook tames the day, and the room settles into a quiet hush. A faint thread of a tune slips past the shutter and dies on the sill. Shadows gather along the bed curtains; the boards creak softly, a patient witness.

Wolf purred, spectacles crooked, "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
He tips a slippered paw toward the doorway. He coughs—a practised, small sound.

"Oh, what a day you must have had," he said, voice higher, kinder.
His fingers drift to the shawl, smoothing the fold. He straightens his spectacles with the back of a claw.

"Sit. Rest. Grandmother will be so grateful."
He settles deeper into the quilt. His tail twitches once beneath the bedskirt, and the corner of his mouth tightens around the edge of a smile.

Dust shivers in a bar of light that escaped the shutters; the clock’s tick grows loud enough to measure nerves.
From far off, a rhythm of axe on wood answers the kettle’s breath, iron and sap interlacing on the air.

Dust trembled in a narrow bar of light that slipped past the hooked shutters, and the mantel clock’s tick grew loud enough to measure nerves. The teapot breathed in soft pulses; the teapot’s lid quivered, kissing the rim. From far off, axe strokes answered the kettle’s breath in a measured rhythm, sap and iron in the air.

Wolf lay propped beneath the strawberry quilt, the bed curtains drawn to a half-theater hush. He patted a dab from the powder tin across the muzzle to soften the snout’s line. He smoothed the feather quilt and tucked its edge to blur the outline beneath, and his tail hid quiet under the bedskirt; the fringe lifted once with the clock’s tick, then settled.
