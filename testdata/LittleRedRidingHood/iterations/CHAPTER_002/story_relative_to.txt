Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise and my nursery tune keeping my feet steady as the sun cut long stripes through the pines—but the lane ahead felt too quiet and my bright hood seemed to hurry me on. I had chosen the narrow deer-track with a wish to be quicker, humming of jam and bread on my lips, and though the wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edge of my memory, I did not see the cottage answer a different voice: I did not see the door yield to a softer knock, the kettle sigh and the latch lift, the way warm mint and ash breathed out like a secret. I imagined the room full and waiting, not the small convulsion of chair and quilt that followed a single swift movement, nor the hush that settled after a startled breath; I only held to the belief that my coming would be met with the familiar, measured voice I remember, and not yet the dimmed, private theatre the cottage has become.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, checked the shingles and found time enough before Red's footfalls, then tested the latch and let my voice smooth itself into a kinlier thing. I let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin, shaped Red’s breathy plea on my tongue, and when the latch clicked and warm mint and ash spilled out I made my move—a single, clean bound—and closed the small mouth of the house on the one who kept its day. The work afterward was careful and domestic: I righted the chair, nudged the saucer true, coaxed steam back into the teapot, powdered my muzzle, tugged on nightcap and spectacles, learned a smaller smile and a cough, drew the shutters to dim the light and folded the cottage into a private, dimmed theatre of welcome; I lay beneath the strawberry quilt like a borrowed story, tail tucked, clock’s tick loud as a metronome, waiting with silk and practiced concern for the bright hood at the threshold.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her small feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf uncoil from my bramble and pad through thyme and cabbage toward the cottage, tasting the jam that rides my air; he checked the lane, measured the sun on the shingles, scanned for witnesses, and let a practiced knock fall as soft as a coin. The cottage answered—latch clicking, kettle sighing, warm mint and ash spilling into the lane—and then it shuddered as chair and quilt moved and stillness reformed; the wolf leapt in a single, private motion and the house folded itself around a new occupant. I felt him smooth powder across his muzzle, tug the nightcap down, adjust spectacles, hook the shutters to thin the daylight into gray hush, and watched the room become a dim little theatre, its domestic sounds folded inward while dust trembled in a thin bar of light and the clock’s tick marked the waiting until her bright song would reach the door.
