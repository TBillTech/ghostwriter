=== SYSTEM ===
You are brainstorming narrative beats as concise bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

ALWAYS keep to the facts. Anything that sounds like dialog we will leave for the dialog parts of the story.  
We need to generate pure narrative pseudo-historical prose.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
He pinched the powder tin of face dust between claws and dabbed it along his muzzle to dull the sheen. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad. Spectacles perched awkwardly on his snout; lenses fogged, smudging the world to blur. Wolf fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.

# Scene
Here is the scene the actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Inside, the Disguise', 'description': 'The aftermath of swallowing Grandma: The chair is knocked over, and the teapot is still warm.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Grandmother’s Nightcap and Spectacles', 'significance': 'Tools of disguise; innocence repurposed', 'description': 'A soft cap with a blue ribbon, and spectacles smudged with use.\nThey pinch the Wolf’s ears and blur his eyes, but lend him a silhouette.\n'}, {'name': 'Feather Quilt and Bed Curtains', 'significance': 'Stage for the masquerade', 'description': 'A puffed quilt stitched with strawberries, curtains that turn a bed into a small theater.\nThey muffle size and shape, smooth the outline of teeth.\n'}, {'name': 'Shutter Hook', 'significance': 'Conspiracy with the dark', 'description': 'A simple hook-and-eye that tames daylight.\nOnce fastened, the room agrees to keep secrets.\n'}, {'name': 'Powder Tin', 'significance': 'A trick to soften a snout', 'description': 'A little tin of rice powder; a dab on the muzzle keeps the fur from gleaming.\n'}]}

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; this is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
He tidies the impression of struggle to nothing, sets the kettle to murmur, and folds the shawl around his shoulders.
In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learns a smaller smile. He tries on a cough the way one tries on a glove.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting each line with an '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown. Do NOT use nested bullets or dashes.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by their `id` field from the setting.
3. **Touch-Point**: Express this moment clearly and concretely; the key action should be visible to the reader (“on camera”), not merely implied.
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To" so that events and logic align with prior context.
5. **Scenes**: You should depict action directly when appropriate. Use sound, motion, rhythm, and consequence to convey the event.
6. **Tone**: Write in the manner of a classic fairytale, cinematic myth, or entertaining space opera — swift, sometimes symbolic, and dwell on implications instead of graphic detail. Focus on transformation, and atmosphere.
7. **Style**: Keep sentences concise and vivid. Each bullet should contribute one clear beat of story progression or imagery.
8. **Format**: Output only bullet points beginning with '*', with no headings or commentary.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to give the readers a picture of the environment and what is objectively happening, with the goal of building upon and making the Touch-Point real. Leave feelings and opinions for later. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.


=== RESPONSE ===
* The tipped chair is set upright by wolf with a careful paw, its scrape brief on the floorboards.
* The scattered shawl is lifted from the floor and folded once, then drawn around wolf’s shoulders to soften his outline.
* The fallen teacup is righted on its saucer, and a faint ring of tea is wiped from the table with the cuff of the shawl’s edge.
* The kettle is settled back on the hook above the coals; wolf nudges embers until a low murmur begins beneath the lid.
* The hearth is coaxed to a steady glow, enough to look tended, not roaring.
* The feather quilt is shaken once to release the telltale crease of a struggle, then smoothed flat across the bed.
* The bed curtains are drawn to a half-closed drape that frames a small, resting silhouette.
* The rug is squared to the bed’s foot; heel scuffs near the door are brushed away with the side of a paw.
* The powder tin is snapped closed and slid beneath the washstand to remove its glare from the room.
* The shutter hook remains fast, letting the lamp make a kinder, blurrier world out of corners.
* The spectacles already perched on wolf’s snout are pushed higher until their smudge hides the shine of his eyes.
* Wolf faces the cloudy mirror and tucks his lips to cover the edge of his teeth, testing a diminished smile.
* He releases a dry, modest cough, then another, measuring their size against the hush of the room.
* A third cough is shaped shorter, practiced until it lands like an old habit rather than a signal.
* A spoon is laid beside the teacup, handle toward the bed, as if a hand expects it soon.
* Wolf adjusts the nightcap’s blue ribbon so it lies centered, then pats the cap to subdue the pricked outline of ears.
* He listens at the shutter for the forest path’s quiet, timing the kettle’s whisper to greet an arrival.
* A second cup is set near the first, empty but waiting, to imply a guest anticipated rather than surprised.
* The door latch is lowered gently and left unbarred, a welcoming detail that promises no recent alarm.
* Wolf settles onto the bed’s pillows, sinking until the quilt erases his breadth, leaving a small rise where a head ought to be.
