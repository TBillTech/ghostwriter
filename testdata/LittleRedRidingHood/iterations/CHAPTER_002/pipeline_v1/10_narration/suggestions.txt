- Remove or reword "the scrape across the creaking boards was brief, like a thing remembered and forgiven." It's poetic but slows the tidy sequence; tighten to a single clear action (e.g., "the scrape across the boards was brief").
- Delete "then folded the scattered shawl once and drew it about his shoulders so the outline softened." Replace with a single, active sentence that directly ties to the touch-point: "folded the shawl and wrapped it around his shoulders, softening his outline."
- Combine or trim the two kettle sentences for clarity and pace. Suggested replacement: "He settled the kettle on the hook above the coals and nudged the embers until it murmured."
- Remove "hid it beneath the washstand." If keeping the powder tin is needed, rephrase less conspicuously (e.g., "snapped the powder tin shut and set it away") to avoid drawing unnecessary attention.
- Replace "pushed the spectacles higher on his snout until the smudge hid the shine of his eyes" with a tighter image: "pushed the spectacles up so the smudge softened his eyes." (avoids awkward phrasing)
- Tighten or clarify "He left the shutter hook fast so the lamp made corners kinder, blurrier." Suggested: "He fastened the shutter so the lamplight softened the room."
- Simplify the quilt/curtain lines by removing redundant verbs: merge "shook the feather quilt once to loosen the crease of struggle, smoothed it flat across the bed, and drew the curtains to a half-closed drape" into one concise sequence (e.g., "He smoothed the quilt and drew the curtains half-closed, framing a small, resting silhouette").
- Change "Wolf’s mouth learned a smaller smile" to a clearer verb: "Wolf formed a smaller smile."
- Clarify the cough progression. Replace the metaphor-heavy "tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove: dry, modest, tested once, then again until the third sat ordinary and harmless" with a precise, short sequence that shows rehearsal: "He tried a dry, modest cough—once, twice—until the third sounded ordinary and harmless."
- Reword the final sentence to avoid the ambiguous "erased his breadth": e.g., "He settled into the pillows until the quilt concealed his bulk, leaving only the gentle rise where a head belonged."
- Scan for any ambiguous pronouns after edits (especially in condensed sentences) and replace with "Wolf" where needed to keep references explicit.
