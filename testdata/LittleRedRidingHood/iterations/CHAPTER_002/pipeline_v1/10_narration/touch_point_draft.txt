Wolf righted-and-stilled the toppled chair with a careful lift so the room forgot the lurch. He nudged the saucer true, drew the teapot toward the heat and poked the hearth until a red seam opened and warmed the air; a faint thread of steam resumed its curl. Wolf flattened the feather quilt where it had heaved, smoothing the strawberry stitches until the puff looked mended, and drew the bed curtains a hand’s width tighter so the hem swallowed awkward edges and softened the bed’s shape.

Wolf found the shutter hook and fastened it into its eye; daylight thinned to a gray hush and the room deepened into a private, dimmed theater. Small domestic noises folded into the dim as if rehearsed: the kettle’s murmur, the quiet clink of china, the hush of curtains settling. Wolf dabbed powder from the tin along the muzzle to dull any fresh gleam, tugged Grandmother’s nightcap down to cover the pinched ears, smoothing the blue ribbon square. He tilted the spectacles to blur his eyes behind glass and folded the shawl around his shoulders.

In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove.
