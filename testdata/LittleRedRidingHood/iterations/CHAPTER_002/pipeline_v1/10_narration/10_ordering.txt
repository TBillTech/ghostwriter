=== SYSTEM ===
You will order and refine brainstormed bullet points for coherent flow.

=== USER ===
You are a director examining the output of a creative brainstorming session, also working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is simply to order the bullets in the most logial sequence possible. You are not allowed to take bullets away.
You are however, allowed to add new intermediate bullets to help the sequence make more sense.

Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
He pinched the powder tin of face dust between claws and dabbed it along his muzzle to dull the sheen. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad. Spectacles perched awkwardly on his snout; lenses fogged, smudging the world to blur. Wolf fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Inside, the Disguise', 'description': 'The aftermath of swallowing Grandma: The chair is knocked over, and the teapot is still warm.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Grandmother’s Nightcap and Spectacles', 'significance': 'Tools of disguise; innocence repurposed', 'description': 'A soft cap with a blue ribbon, and spectacles smudged with use.\nThey pinch the Wolf’s ears and blur his eyes, but lend him a silhouette.\n'}, {'name': 'Feather Quilt and Bed Curtains', 'significance': 'Stage for the masquerade', 'description': 'A puffed quilt stitched with strawberries, curtains that turn a bed into a small theater.\nThey muffle size and shape, smooth the outline of teeth.\n'}, {'name': 'Shutter Hook', 'significance': 'Conspiracy with the dark', 'description': 'A simple hook-and-eye that tames daylight.\nOnce fastened, the room agrees to keep secrets.\n'}, {'name': 'Powder Tin', 'significance': 'A trick to soften a snout', 'description': 'A little tin of rice powder; a dab on the muzzle keeps the fur from gleaming.\n'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
The, Wolf

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide your results as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character.
2. **Clean Lines**: If there are intent words at the beginning of the given bullets, for example "Clarity - ", or "Flavor: " leave those out and just recover the point without a title.
3. **Just Bullets Output**: Strip off, ignore, and do not output any markdown or other formatting, other than just only '*' character at line start.

Now, Here are the Bullets to be ordered in as logical a way as possible:
* The tipped chair is set upright by wolf with a careful paw, its scrape brief on the floorboards.
* The scattered shawl is lifted from the floor and folded once, then drawn around wolf’s shoulders to soften his outline.
* The fallen teacup is righted on its saucer, and a faint ring of tea is wiped from the table with the cuff of the shawl’s edge.
* The kettle is settled back on the hook above the coals; wolf nudges embers until a low murmur begins beneath the lid.
* The hearth is coaxed to a steady glow, enough to look tended, not roaring.
* The feather quilt is shaken once to release the telltale crease of a struggle, then smoothed flat across the bed.
* The bed curtains are drawn to a half-closed drape that frames a small, resting silhouette.
* The rug is squared to the bed’s foot; heel scuffs near the door are brushed away with the side of a paw.
* The powder tin is snapped closed and slid beneath the washstand to remove its glare from the room.
* The shutter hook remains fast, letting the lamp make a kinder, blurrier world out of corners.
* The spectacles already perched on wolf’s snout are pushed higher until their smudge hides the shine of his eyes.
* Wolf faces the cloudy mirror and tucks his lips to cover the edge of his teeth, testing a diminished smile.
* He releases a dry, modest cough, then another, measuring their size against the hush of the room.
* A third cough is shaped shorter, practiced until it lands like an old habit rather than a signal.
* Wolf settles onto the bed’s pillows, sinking until the quilt erases his breadth, leaving a small rise where a head ought to be.
