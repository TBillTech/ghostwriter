- Replace repeated “Wolf”/“wolf” inconsistency with a single chosen form (prefer capitalized "Wolf") throughout.

- Fix typo: change "dimened" to "dimmed."

- Strengthen the opening sentence to more directly “tidy the impression of struggle to nothing” — tighten to show deliberate smoothing (e.g., compress two actions into one crisp verb: righted-and-stilled) so the erasure of struggle reads intentional, not incidental.

- Remove redundancy around domestic sounds: cut one of the two similar sentences describing the kettle, china, and curtains settling. Keep the most vivid line and delete the other to tighten rhythm.

- Combine or trim repetitive actions (nudged the saucer / slid the teapot / urged the hearth coals) — condense into fewer, cleaner beats so each gesture feels purposeful and ceremonial rather than catalog-like.

- Make the shawl action match the touch-point phrasing more literally: change “folded the shawl from the chair-back around wolf’s shoulders” to “folded the shawl around his shoulders” (or “around Wolf’s shoulders”) to echo the required line.

- Add the mirror moment and internal micro-performance: insert a brief line after the shawl is placed — mirror’s dim, his mouth learns a smaller smile — keeping the Wolf’s theatrical cadence. Keep it short and in voice.

- Add the subtle performative cough image immediately after the smaller smile: “He tries on a cough the way one tries on a glove.” Keep it in Wolf’s voice and avoid making it clumsy or melodramatic.

- Clarify ambiguous references: replace “it” in “so the room forgot it had ever lurched” with “the room” or rephrase to avoid any unclear antecedent.

- Soften or remove the line “smoothing the blue ribbon until it lay square” if it slows the paragraph; otherwise make it tighter (e.g., “smoothing the blue ribbon square”) to preserve momentum.

- Make the spectacle placement more purposeful: change “set the spectacles askew just enough to blur the bright of wolf’s eyes behind glass” to “tilted the spectacles to blur his eyes behind glass” — shorter and clearer.

- Maintain the Wolf’s sly theatricality in any new or tightened lines: prefer words implying performance (tries, learns, arranges, rehearses) and keep any flatter, modern diction out.

- Run a single pass to vary sentence length—alternate short, punchy sentences (for decisive acts) with longer, soft sentences (for the domestic hush) to preserve voice and pacing.
