- Replace paragraph-initial pronouns with the proper name where ambiguous: change "He shook the feather quilt..." to "Wolf shook the feather quilt..." (and any other sentences starting with "He" that could refer to someone else).

- Make the touch-point phrasing more explicit and present: change "nudged the embers until a low murmur began beneath the lid" to "set the kettle to murmur" (or include that exact phrase in addition to the ember detail).

- Tighten the mirror / smile sentence to match the touch-point wording: change "Facing the cloudy mirror, Wolf tucked his lips to cover the edge of his teeth and practiced a smaller smile." to something closer to "In the mirror’s dim, Wolf’s mouth learned a smaller smile." (or insert that clause immediately before/after the existing line).

- Strengthen the cough-as-glove image to match the touch-point: replace "He released a dry, modest cough—then another—measuring each against the hush until the third came short and ordinary" with a line that echoes the simile, e.g. "Wolf tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove: dry, modest, tested once, then again until the third sat ordinary and harmless."

- Remove or compress small redundant details that dilute the main actions (e.g., "The powder tin snapped shut and slid beneath the washstand to keep its gleam from catching the lamplight." can be shortened to "He snapped the powder tin shut and hid it beneath the washstand."), keeping focus on the tidy, performed calm.

- Ensure the "tidy the impression of struggle to nothing" is explicit: add a brief line tying the actions together, e.g. "Each motion tidied the impression of struggle to nothing," placed after the list of small restorations.

- Avoid passive or wordy phrasing that softens agency (e.g., change "The hearth answered to his coaxing, a steady glow—tended, not roaring—that made the room feel like a kept secret." to "The hearth answered his coaxing with a steady, tended glow, turning the room into a kept secret.")
