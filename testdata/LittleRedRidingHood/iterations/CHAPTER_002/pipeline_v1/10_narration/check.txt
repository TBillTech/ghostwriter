You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room. The chair tipped and clattered; the cup rattled in its saucer. The feather quilt shuddered with a rush of air. Curtains stirred and then stilled, and the cottage convulsed in a small, domestic tumble—Grandmother's world set into motion and then arrested.

The Wolf stepped forward in a single, smooth bound that found the middle of the floor. A startled breath escaped Grandmother. The Wolf opened wide with a swift upward tilt and swallowed Grandmother whole in one smooth bite. The teapot sighed, and a hush filled the room.

The Wolf's belly rounded, firm and high; the floorboards groaned under the new heft as the Wolf tested his balance, rolled his shoulders once, smoothed powder across his muzzle, and arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened—pleasing work, patient as hunger.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
He tidies the impression of struggle to nothing, sets the kettle to murmur, and folds the shawl around his shoulders.
In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learns a smaller smile. He tries on a cough the way one tries on a glove.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Wolf righted-and-stilled the toppled chair with a careful lift so the room forgot the lurch. He nudged the saucer true, drew the teapot toward the heat and poked the hearth until a red seam opened and warmed the air; a faint thread of steam resumed its curl. Wolf flattened the feather quilt where it had heaved, smoothing the strawberry stitches until the puff looked mended, and drew the bed curtains a hand’s width tighter so the hem swallowed awkward edges and softened the bed’s shape.

Wolf found the shutter hook and fastened it into its eye; daylight thinned to a gray hush and the room deepened into a private, dimmed theater. Small domestic noises folded into the dim as if rehearsed: the kettle’s murmur, the quiet clink of china, the hush of curtains settling. Wolf dabbed powder from the tin along the muzzle to dull any fresh gleam, tugged Grandmother’s nightcap down to cover the pinched ears, smoothing the blue ribbon square. He tilted the spectacles to blur his eyes behind glass and folded the shawl around his shoulders.

In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove the hyphenation in the opening phrase; change "Wolf righted-and-stilled" to "Wolf righted and stilled" for smoother cadence.

- Trim redundancy in the first sentence: delete "so the room forgot the lurch." Instead let the precise actions carry the effect (e.g., end sentence after "stilled").

- Replace "poked the hearth until a red seam opened" with a firmer verb that suits the Wolf's practiced domesticity—suggest "stoked" or "nudged the embers until a red seam opened"—to avoid a clumsy image.

- Shorten the list of small repairs into two tight clauses to keep momentum. Example: collapse "flattened the feather quilt... smoothing the strawberry stitches until the puff looked mended, and drew the bed curtains..." into "flattened the feather quilt and smoothed the stitches, then drew the curtains a hand’s width tighter" (keeps voice but reduces stacking).

- Remove "so the hem swallowed awkward edges and softened the bed’s shape" (wordy metaphor). If you want the softening image, compress: "so the hem softened the bed’s outline."

- Change "Wolf found the shutter hook and fastened it into its eye" to "Wolf fastened the shutter hook" — cut the anthropomorphic "its eye" which slightly confuses focus and slows the sentence.

- Reduce repetition around domestic sounds: pick either "the kettle’s murmur" or "the kettle murmured." Keep one vivid auditory image; delete the extra phrasing "Small domestic noises folded into the dim as if rehearsed: the kettle’s murmur, the quiet clink of china, the hush of curtains settling." For example: "Domestic sounds folded into the dim—the kettle’s murmur, the clink of china."

- Tighten the grooming sequence for clarity and menace: reorder to foreground the deliberate concealment (powder, nightcap, spectacles, shawl). Make each action a short verb phrase: "He dabbed powder, tugged the nightcap down, tilted the spectacles, and folded the shawl about his shoulders." This emphasizes intentional performance.

- Replace "to dull any fresh gleam" with "to dull any fresh gleam of blood" only if you intend to allude overtly; otherwise keep it ambiguous: "to dull any fresh gleam" is fine but consider "to dull any fresh shine" if you want less literalness.

- Remove the passive "the blue ribbon square" — make it active and specific: "smoothing the blue ribbon into a neat square."

- Make the final two sentences stand even more stark and theatrical by placing them flush and slightly varied in rhythm. Consider adding a brief sensory anchor before the mirror line (a single-word image like "mirror" or "glass"): e.g., "Before the dim mirror, his mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove." (Keep exactly the touch-point phrasing but ensure it follows the tightened grooming sentence.)

- Check pronoun clarity: where you use "he" in successive sentences, consider repeating "Wolf" once or twice in the paragraph to avoid any momentary ambiguity and to preserve the persona.

- Tone consistency: preserve the Wolf's theatrical, patient cadence—avoid pastoral or overly cozy diction ("strawberry stitches," "puff looked mended") that leans too domestic; replace with slightly tauter images to match the Wolf's sinister composure (e.g., "stitched pattern" instead of "strawberry stitches").

- Final pass: read aloud to maintain the Wolf's smooth, persuasive cadence—shorten or split any sentence that trips on too many domestic details so the closing mirror/cough lines land with the intended quiet menace.
