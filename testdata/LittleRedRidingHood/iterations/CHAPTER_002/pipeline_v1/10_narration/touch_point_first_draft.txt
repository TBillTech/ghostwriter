Wolf righted the toppled chair with a careful lift and a quiet set-down so the room forgot it had ever lurched. Wolf nudged the saucer beneath the rattled cup until porcelain sat true and steady, then slid the teapot toward the heat until a faint thread of steam resumed its curl. Wolf urged the hearth coals with the poker; a red seam opened and breathed warm again, and the kettle metal answered with a low murmur, small and domestic as if nothing had changed. Wolf flattened the feather quilt where it had heaved, smoothing the strawberry stitches until the puff looked mended and innocent, and drew the bed curtains a hand’s width tighter so the hem swallowed awkward edges and softened the shape of the bed.

Wolf found the shutter hook and fastened it into its eye; daylight thinned to a gray hush and the room deepened into a private, dimened theater. Small domestic noises folded into the dim as if rehearsed: the kettle’s murmur, the quiet clink of china, the hush of curtains settling. Wolf dabbed powder from the powder tin once more along the muzzle to dull any fresh gleam and tugged Grandmother’s nightcap down to cover the pinched ears, smoothing the blue ribbon until it lay square. Wolf set the spectacles askew just enough to blur the bright of wolf’s eyes behind glass and folded the shawl from the chair-back around wolf’s shoulders, the tassels hiding breadth and giving the silhouette the gentleness of a borrowed shape.
