Wolf set the tipped chair upright with a careful paw; the scrape across the creaking boards was brief, like a thing remembered and forgiven. He squared the rug at the bed’s foot, brushed the heel scuffs near the door with the side of a paw as if erasing footprints from a page, then folded the scattered shawl once and drew it about his shoulders so the outline softened. The fallen teacup was righted on its saucer; with the cuff of the shawl’s edge he wiped a faint ring of tea from the table until the wood looked tended. He settled the kettle back on the hook above the coals and nudged the embers until a low murmur began beneath the lid. The hearth answered to his coaxing, a steady glow—tended, not roaring—that made the room feel like a kept secret. The powder tin snapped shut and slid beneath the washstand to keep its gleam from catching the lamplight. Wolf pushed the spectacles higher on his snout until the smudge hid the shine of his eyes, and he left the shutter hook fast so the lamp made corners kinder, blurrier.

He shook the feather quilt once to loosen the crease of struggle, smoothed it flat across the bed, and drew the curtains to a half-closed drape that framed a small, resting silhouette. Facing the cloudy mirror, Wolf tucked his lips to cover the edge of his teeth and practiced a smaller smile. He released a dry, modest cough—then another—measuring each against the hush until the third came short and ordinary, an old habit rather than an alarm. At last Wolf settled into the pillows, sinking until the quilt erased his breadth and left only the gentle rise where a head ought to be.
