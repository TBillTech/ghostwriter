# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
He tidies the impression of struggle to nothing, sets the kettle to murmur, and folds the shawl around his shoulders.
In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learns a smaller smile. He tries on a cough the way one tries on a glove.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Wolf set the tipped chair upright with a careful paw; the scrape across the creaking boards was brief, like a thing remembered and forgiven. He squared the rug at the bed’s foot, brushed the heel scuffs near the door with the side of a paw as if erasing footprints from a page, then folded the scattered shawl once and drew it about his shoulders so the outline softened. The fallen teacup was righted on its saucer; with the cuff of the shawl’s edge he wiped a faint ring of tea from the table until the wood looked tended. He settled the kettle back on the hook above the coals and nudged the embers until a low murmur began beneath the lid. The hearth answered to his coaxing, a steady glow—tended, not roaring—that made the room feel like a kept secret. The powder tin snapped shut and slid beneath the washstand to keep its gleam from catching the lamplight. Wolf pushed the spectacles higher on his snout until the smudge hid the shine of his eyes, and he left the shutter hook fast so the lamp made corners kinder, blurrier.

He shook the feather quilt once to loosen the crease of struggle, smoothed it flat across the bed, and drew the curtains to a half-closed drape that framed a small, resting silhouette. Facing the cloudy mirror, Wolf tucked his lips to cover the edge of his teeth and practiced a smaller smile. He released a dry, modest cough—then another—measuring each against the hush until the third came short and ordinary, an old habit rather than an alarm. At last Wolf settled into the pillows, sinking until the quilt erased his breadth and left only the gentle rise where a head ought to be.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace paragraph-initial pronouns with the proper name where ambiguous: change "He shook the feather quilt..." to "Wolf shook the feather quilt..." (and any other sentences starting with "He" that could refer to someone else).

- Make the touch-point phrasing more explicit and present: change "nudged the embers until a low murmur began beneath the lid" to "set the kettle to murmur" (or include that exact phrase in addition to the ember detail).

- Tighten the mirror / smile sentence to match the touch-point wording: change "Facing the cloudy mirror, Wolf tucked his lips to cover the edge of his teeth and practiced a smaller smile." to something closer to "In the mirror’s dim, Wolf’s mouth learned a smaller smile." (or insert that clause immediately before/after the existing line).

- Strengthen the cough-as-glove image to match the touch-point: replace "He released a dry, modest cough—then another—measuring each against the hush until the third came short and ordinary" with a line that echoes the simile, e.g. "Wolf tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove: dry, modest, tested once, then again until the third sat ordinary and harmless."

- Remove or compress small redundant details that dilute the main actions (e.g., "The powder tin snapped shut and slid beneath the washstand to keep its gleam from catching the lamplight." can be shortened to "He snapped the powder tin shut and hid it beneath the washstand."), keeping focus on the tidy, performed calm.

- Ensure the "tidy the impression of struggle to nothing" is explicit: add a brief line tying the actions together, e.g. "Each motion tidied the impression of struggle to nothing," placed after the list of small restorations.

- Avoid passive or wordy phrasing that softens agency (e.g., change "The hearth answered to his coaxing, a steady glow—tended, not roaring—that made the room feel like a kept secret." to "The hearth answered his coaxing with a steady, tended glow, turning the room into a kept secret.")

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.
