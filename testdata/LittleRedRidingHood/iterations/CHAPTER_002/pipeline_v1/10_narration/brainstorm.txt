* The tipped chair is set upright by wolf with a careful paw, its scrape brief on the floorboards.
* The scattered shawl is lifted from the floor and folded once, then drawn around wolf’s shoulders to soften his outline.
* The fallen teacup is righted on its saucer, and a faint ring of tea is wiped from the table with the cuff of the shawl’s edge.
* The kettle is settled back on the hook above the coals; wolf nudges embers until a low murmur begins beneath the lid.
* The hearth is coaxed to a steady glow, enough to look tended, not roaring.
* The feather quilt is shaken once to release the telltale crease of a struggle, then smoothed flat across the bed.
* The bed curtains are drawn to a half-closed drape that frames a small, resting silhouette.
* The rug is squared to the bed’s foot; heel scuffs near the door are brushed away with the side of a paw.
* The powder tin is snapped closed and slid beneath the washstand to remove its glare from the room.
* The shutter hook remains fast, letting the lamp make a kinder, blurrier world out of corners.
* The spectacles already perched on wolf’s snout are pushed higher until their smudge hides the shine of his eyes.
* Wolf faces the cloudy mirror and tucks his lips to cover the edge of his teeth, testing a diminished smile.
* He releases a dry, modest cough, then another, measuring their size against the hush of the room.
* A third cough is shaped shorter, practiced until it lands like an old habit rather than a signal.
* Wolf settles onto the bed’s pillows, sinking until the quilt erases his breadth, leaving a small rise where a head ought to be.
