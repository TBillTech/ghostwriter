* wolf rights the toppled chair with a careful lift and a quiet set-down
* The saucer is nudged beneath the rattled cup until porcelain sits true again
* The feather quilt is patted flat where it heaved, strawberry stitches smoothed to stillness
* Bed curtains are drawn a hand’s width tighter, their hem swallowing edges and angles
* The shutter hook finds its eye; daylight thins to a gray hush and the room deepens
* Hearth coals are urged with the poker; a red seam opens and breathes warm again
* The teapot is slid toward the heat until a faint thread of steam resumes its curl
* Kettle metal answers with a low murmur, small and domestic as if nothing has changed
* Powder from the tin is dabbed once more to dull any fresh gleam along the muzzle line
* Grandmother’s nightcap is tugged to cover the pinched ears; the blue ribbon is squared
* Spectacles are set askew just enough to blur the bright of wolfs’ eyes behind glass
* A shawl from the chair-back is folded around wolf’s shoulders, tassels hiding breadth
