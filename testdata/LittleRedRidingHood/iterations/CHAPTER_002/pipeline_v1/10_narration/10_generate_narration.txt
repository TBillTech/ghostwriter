Touch-Point
===========
Text: He tidies the impression of struggle to nothing, sets the kettle to murmur, and folds the shawl around his shoulders.
In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learns a smaller smile. He tries on a cough the way one tries on a glove.


State
=====
- Scene: {'name': 'Inside, the Disguise', 'description': 'The aftermath of swallowing Grandma: The chair is knocked over, and the teapot is still warm.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Grandmother’s Nightcap and Spectacles', 'significance': 'Tools of disguise; innocence repurposed', 'description': 'A soft cap with a blue ribbon, and spectacles smudged with use.\nThey pinch the Wolf’s ears and blur his eyes, but lend him a silhouette.\n'}, {'name': 'Feather Quilt and Bed Curtains', 'significance': 'Stage for the masquerade', 'description': 'A puffed quilt stitched with strawberries, curtains that turn a bed into a small theater.\nThey muffle size and shape, smooth the outline of teeth.\n'}, {'name': 'Shutter Hook', 'significance': 'Conspiracy with the dark', 'description': 'A simple hook-and-eye that tames daylight.\nOnce fastened, the room agrees to keep secrets.\n'}, {'name': 'Powder Tin', 'significance': 'A trick to soften a snout', 'description': 'A little tin of rice powder; a dab on the muzzle keeps the fur from gleaming.\n'}]}
- Actors: The, Wolf
- Foreshadowing: 
- Prior paragraph (if any): He pinched the powder tin of face dust between claws and dabbed it along his muzzle to dull the sheen. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad. Spectacles perched awkwardly on his snout; lenses fogged, smudging the world to blur. Wolf fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.

Ordered bullets
===============
* The tipped chair is set upright by wolf with a careful paw, its scrape brief on the floorboards.
* The rug is squared to the bed’s foot; heel scuffs near the door are brushed away with the side of a paw.
* The scattered shawl is lifted from the floor and folded once, then drawn around wolf’s shoulders to soften his outline.
* The fallen teacup is righted on its saucer, and a faint ring of tea is wiped from the table with the cuff of the shawl’s edge.
* The kettle is settled back on the hook above the coals; wolf nudges embers until a low murmur begins beneath the lid.
* The hearth is coaxed to a steady glow, enough to look tended, not roaring.
* The powder tin is snapped closed and slid beneath the washstand to remove its glare from the room.
* The spectacles already perched on wolf’s snout are pushed higher until their smudge hides the shine of his eyes.
* The shutter hook remains fast, letting the lamp make a kinder, blurrier world out of corners.
* The feather quilt is shaken once to release the telltale crease of a struggle, then smoothed flat across the bed.
* The bed curtains are drawn to a half-closed drape that frames a small, resting silhouette.
* Wolf faces the cloudy mirror and tucks his lips to cover the edge of his teeth, testing a diminished smile.
* He releases a dry, modest cough, then another, measuring their size against the hush of the room.
* A third cough is shaped shorter, practiced until it lands like an old habit rather than a signal.
* Wolf settles onto the bed’s pillows, sinking until the quilt erases his breadth, leaving a small rise where a head ought to be.

- Keep it vivid, concise, and in the established voice.
- Do not include bullet markers or headings in your output.

- Strongly prefer using proper names over pronouns like "they", "him", "it".


=== RESPONSE ===
Wolf set the tipped chair upright with a careful paw; the scrape across the creaking boards was brief, like a thing remembered and forgiven. He squared the rug at the bed’s foot, brushed the heel scuffs near the door with the side of a paw as if erasing footprints from a page, then folded the scattered shawl once and drew it about his shoulders so the outline softened. The fallen teacup was righted on its saucer; with the cuff of the shawl’s edge he wiped a faint ring of tea from the table until the wood looked tended. He settled the kettle back on the hook above the coals and nudged the embers until a low murmur began beneath the lid. The hearth answered to his coaxing, a steady glow—tended, not roaring—that made the room feel like a kept secret. The powder tin snapped shut and slid beneath the washstand to keep its gleam from catching the lamplight. Wolf pushed the spectacles higher on his snout until the smudge hid the shine of his eyes, and he left the shutter hook fast so the lamp made corners kinder, blurrier.

He shook the feather quilt once to loosen the crease of struggle, smoothed it flat across the bed, and drew the curtains to a half-closed drape that framed a small, resting silhouette. Facing the cloudy mirror, Wolf tucked his lips to cover the edge of his teeth and practiced a smaller smile. He released a dry, modest cough—then another—measuring each against the hush until the third came short and ordinary, an old habit rather than an alarm. At last Wolf settled into the pillows, sinking until the quilt erased his breadth and left only the gentle rise where a head ought to be.
