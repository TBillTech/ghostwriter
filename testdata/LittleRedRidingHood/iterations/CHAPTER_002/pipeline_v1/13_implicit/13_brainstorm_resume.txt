=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm implicit dialog beats (indirect, subtext) as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, but to do it indirectly!
Ask yourself, what points could be of great interest to the audience, and be inferred from the touch-point. Come up with creative ideas that are small pieces of the touch-point, but be cagey and don't just dump the idea on the reader.
For example, it may help to imagine that the audience might be offended by just coming out and saying it.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
The Wolf practiced. The kettle hissed softly.

"Listen—" he said.

"Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."

"Oh, what a day you must have had. Put the basket down, dear — the bread needs its rest."

"Long path, was it? You must be tired from the pines." He paused. "Forgive my prattle — come closer, my ears aren't what they were."

Softly, he added, "Grandmother will be grateful if you hurry inside; she does not like to wait."

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be artfully danced around:
Dust shivers in a bar of light that escaped the shutters; the clock’s tick grows loud enough to measure nerves.
From far off, a rhythm of axe on wood answers the kettle’s breath, iron and sap interlacing on the air.



# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Indirectly alluding to this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to suggest things to the readers mind, with the goal of making the touch point seem to emerge like an aha-moment. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.

=== RESPONSE ===
* wolf glances at the shutter hook and nudges it tighter, then smiles to himself about how bright mornings make old eyes ache
* wolf rehearses a cough timed to the clock, as if the room’s patience were a visitor to be entertained
* wolf pats the feather quilt when the kettle sighs, murmuring hush now, little river, don’t tell on us
* wolf tilts the spectacles, squinting through the smudge, and remarks that dust will dance for any stray sun, the shameless thing
* wolf lets a low chuckle ride after saying do mind the curtains, dear, the day is too bold
* wolf smooths the powder on his snout and observes that a good face is a quiet one, not given to shine
* wolf pauses mid-practice when a distant thock-thock threads the air, then calls it neighborly industry and not worth a fret
* wolf counts his next line under his breath, matching it to the pendulum as if charity had a beat
* wolf compliments the imagined visitor’s red hood, noting how such color startles shy rooms, better to fold it down
* wolf tests a kindly tremor in his voice that rises and falls with the kettle, as if breath could be borrowed
* wolf flinches at a louder chop, then masks it by fussing with the nightcap ribbon, claiming the bow refuses good manners today
* wolf coos that brisk work makes strong arms, and isn’t it sweet how the world looks after itself, all the while shifting deeper into the bed’s theater
* wolf touches the overturned chair with a toe and whispers that some furniture never learns to sit properly when mornings are so busy
* wolf adds, only a suggestion, of course, but shut the hook when you come, dear; a draught can set clocks bragging and they do go on
