* wolf glances at the shutter hook and nudges it tighter, then smiles to himself about how bright mornings make old eyes ache
* wolf rehearses a cough timed to the clock, as if the room’s patience were a visitor to be entertained
* wolf pats the feather quilt when the kettle sighs, murmuring hush now, little river, don’t tell on us
* wolf tilts the spectacles, squinting through the smudge, and remarks that dust will dance for any stray sun, the shameless thing
* wolf lets a low chuckle ride after saying do mind the curtains, dear, the day is too bold
* wolf smooths the powder on his snout and observes that a good face is a quiet one, not given to shine
* wolf pauses mid-practice when a distant thock-thock threads the air, then calls it neighborly industry and not worth a fret
* wolf counts his next line under his breath, matching it to the pendulum as if charity had a beat
* wolf compliments the imagined visitor’s red hood, noting how such color startles shy rooms, better to fold it down
* wolf tests a kindly tremor in his voice that rises and falls with the kettle, as if breath could be borrowed
* wolf flinches at a louder chop, then masks it by fussing with the nightcap ribbon, claiming the bow refuses good manners today
* wolf coos that brisk work makes strong arms, and isn’t it sweet how the world looks after itself, all the while shifting deeper into the bed’s theater
* wolf touches the overturned chair with a toe and whispers that some furniture never learns to sit properly when mornings are so busy
* wolf adds, only a suggestion, of course, but shut the hook when you come, dear; a draught can set clocks bragging and they do go on
