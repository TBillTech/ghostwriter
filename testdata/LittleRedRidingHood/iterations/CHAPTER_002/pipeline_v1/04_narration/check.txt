You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Wolf, Grandmother

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock.
He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning, warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney. He pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat. Nettle and wood smoke rose from Grandmother's kettle. Wolf listened toward the lane: no footfall, no Red yet, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door.

Wolf measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage. Wolf checked the hedge and the path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter, no neighbor. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath. He padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room’s tiny sounds, and studied the thumb-worn latch; the iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. Behind closed teeth he rehearsed the cadence he would wear.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove one of the duplicated smoke/household images to avoid clutter (either "warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney" or "Nettle and wood smoke rose from Grandmother's kettle" — keep the stronger single image).

- Delete or tighten the near-duplicate statements about sound: combine "bees droning, warm smoke rising..." with "no footfall, no Red yet, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door" into one tighter listening sentence that foregrounds the touch-point (the garden's stillness and the clock).

- Move "He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath" earlier so the sequence clearly follows the touch-point: first listen/confirm no Red, then smooth his voice, then pad to the door. (Suggested placement: immediately after the sentence that ends with "no Red yet, only the slow metronome...".)

- Replace "pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat" with a single, sharper image (e.g., "rested a paw in the warm earth, shaking pine needles from his coat") to reduce wordiness and keep cadence nimble.

- Change "Wolf measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage." to something more active and concise that reinforces the Wolf's patient calculation (e.g., "He measured the sun on the shingles—time enough before Red could reach the cottage.").

- Shorten the hedge/witness list to remove redundancy: replace "no hound, no hunter, no neighbor" with "no hound, no hunter" (neighbors feel unnecessary here).

- Clarify antecedent where needed: in "the iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word" make explicit that the latch is Grandmother's latch to avoid possible ambiguity (e.g., "Grandmother's iron latch glowed faint...").

- Soften or specify "Behind closed teeth he rehearsed the cadence he would wear." Consider replacing with a brief wolf-voice sample or a hint of his theatrical manner (one short line in his voice) to keep the writer's quirks alive and show rather than tell (e.g., add: ' "Such a charming hood," he murmured to himself, testing the shape of the lie.').

- Remove passive or redundant modifiers that slow rhythm ("would be time" → "time"; "checked the hedge and the path for witnesses" → "scanned hedge and path for witnesses") to preserve the Wolf's sleekness.

- Ensure the final sentence leads directly into the doorway action: end the paragraph with the Wolf padding to the doorstep and listening to the room's tiny sounds—keep that as the closing image so the touch-point is the dominant takeaway.
