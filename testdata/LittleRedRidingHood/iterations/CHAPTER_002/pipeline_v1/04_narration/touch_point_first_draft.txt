Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning, warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney. He pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat, the little tremor scattering needles like shrugged-off thoughts. Nettle tea and wood-ash rode the air on the kettle's soft exhalations; the Hearth and Kettle stitched the room inside together with steam. Wolf listened toward the lane: no footfall, no red hood at the gate, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door.

He measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage. Wolf checked the hedge and the path for witnesses: no dog, no hunter, no neighbor's voice to spoil the quiet. He padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room’s tiny sounds, and studied the Cottage Door-Latch; the thumb-worn iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. Wolf matched his breathing to the clock's tick, shaping his throat to borrowed civility, and behind closed teeth rehearsed the cadence he would wear—his voice readied like a blade sheathed in silk.
