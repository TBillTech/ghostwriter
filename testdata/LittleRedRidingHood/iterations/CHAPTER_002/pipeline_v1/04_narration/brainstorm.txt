* The garden holds stillness broken only by bees and the far, steady tick of an unseen clock.
* wolf arrives first, having NOT taken the deer track that Red is following.
* No figure in a Red Hood appears on the lane; the path beyond the gate lies empty.
* wolf pauses among thyme and cabbages, testing the air for bread and jam but catching only mint and ash.
* The cottage windows stand small and clean, with curtains that barely stir.
* The kettle’s soft breath threads through the door seams, marking a household at ease.
* The sun-bleached Cottage Door-Latch shows thumb-smooth metal, warmed by afternoon light.
* The hazel Walking Stick leans by the jamb inside, visible through the crack where the door meets the frame.
* The Teacup on Saucer rests by a chair draped with a shawl, a hairline crack glinting when a cloud shifts.
* The clock inside keeps a slow metronome that wolf counts against his own breaths.
* wolf smooths his throat to shape a borrowed civility, preparing cadence and pause without sound.
* He pads from shadow to sill, placing paws between creaking boards of the step.
* He notes the hinge pins bright where often used, predicting a quiet swing if lifted as the latch falls.
* The herb beds brush his fur with thyme scent, a cover for any stray musk he carries.
* He studies the latch’s height and the rhythm of familiar knocks that would win it open.
* With the garden listening and the clock steady, wolf closes the last steps to the door.
