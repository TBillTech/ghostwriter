* wolf pauses among thyme and cabbages; the garden holds steady in bees and warm smoke.
* He listens toward the lane; no footfall, no red hood at the gate, only the slow clock inside.
* He scents nettle tea and ash; the kettle’s breath threads the air from the chimney.
* He measures the sun on the shingles; there is time before red hood could reach the cottage.
* He checks the hedge and the path for witnesses; no dog, no hunter, no neighboring voice.
* He presses one paw to the warm dirt and shakes pine needles from his coat.
* He settles his breathing to the clock’s tick, shaping his throat for borrowed civility.
* He studies the door’s thumb-worn iron; the latch glows faintly with afternoon heat.
* He rehearses a familiar cadence behind closed teeth; his voice readied like a sheathed blade.
