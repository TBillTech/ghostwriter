Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning, warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney. He pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat. Nettle and wood smoke rose from Grandmother's kettle. Wolf listened toward the lane: no footfall, no Red yet, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door.

Wolf measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage. Wolf checked the hedge and the path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter, no neighbor. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath. He padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room’s tiny sounds, and studied the thumb-worn latch; the iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. Behind closed teeth he rehearsed the cadence he would wear.
