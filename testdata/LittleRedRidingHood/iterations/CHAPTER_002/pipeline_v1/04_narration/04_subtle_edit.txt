# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock.
He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The Wolf arrived first, having left the deer track where Red would later wander. Beyond the gate the lane lay empty, no bright hood anywhere on the winding path. The garden held its breath—still save for bees and the far, steady tick of an unseen clock—and thyme and cabbages brushed against the Wolf's fur like a soft accusation, their mint and ash hiding whatever stray musk he brought with him. He paused among the herbs, testing the air for bread and jam and finding only the kettle's soft breath threading through the door seams, the sound of a household at ease. The cottage windows were small and clean, curtains barely stirring; a teacup on its saucer waited by a chair draped with Grandmother's shawl, a hairline crack glinting when a cloud shifted. Through the narrow split where door met frame the walking stick leaned by the jamb—hazel, polished by years of palms—and the sun-bleached latch showed thumb-worn iron, warm from afternoon light.

Inside, the clock kept its slow metronome and the Wolf counted its beats against his own breaths as he padded from shadow to sill, placing careful paws between the creaking boards of the step. He noted the hinge pins bright with use and pictured the quiet swing that would follow if the latch fell; he measured the latch's height and memorized the rhythm of familiar knocks that would open this particular threshold. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, shaping a borrowed civility—cadence and pause formed without sound—and with the garden listening and the clock steady he closed the last steps to the cottage door.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Change tense to present to match the touch-point's immediacy (e.g., "The Wolf stands..." instead of "The Wolf arrived first").
- Replace/open with the touch-point sentence or integrate it verbatim: "The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock."
- After that line, keep the existing "He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath" phrase and follow with an explicit motion that mirrors the touch-point: "then pads to the door" (replace "he closed the last steps to the cottage door" with "then pads to the door").
- Remove or condense small, extraneous details that pull focus from the touch-point (e.g., shorten the teacup/hairline-crack sentence and the long enumerations of hinge pins/knock rhythms). Keep only details that support the Wolf's listening/staging.
- Avoid ambiguous pronoun openings in new/rewritten paragraphs—start with "The Wolf" or "Grandmother" rather than "He" or "They" when introducing actions or shifts.
- Keep sensory lines tied to the main idea of listening and preparation (trim descriptive asides like "thyme and cabbages brushed..." to one concise image that reinforces scent masking and the Wolf's vigilance).
- Ensure no new dialogue or lines are attributed to actors other than "The Wolf" or "Grandmother."

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.
