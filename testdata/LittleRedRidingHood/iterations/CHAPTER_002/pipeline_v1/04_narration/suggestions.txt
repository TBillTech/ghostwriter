- Remove one of the duplicated smoke/household images to avoid clutter (either "warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney" or "Nettle and wood smoke rose from Grandmother's kettle" — keep the stronger single image).

- Delete or tighten the near-duplicate statements about sound: combine "bees droning, warm smoke rising..." with "no footfall, no Red yet, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door" into one tighter listening sentence that foregrounds the touch-point (the garden's stillness and the clock).

- Move "He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath" earlier so the sequence clearly follows the touch-point: first listen/confirm no Red, then smooth his voice, then pad to the door. (Suggested placement: immediately after the sentence that ends with "no Red yet, only the slow metronome...".)

- Replace "pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat" with a single, sharper image (e.g., "rested a paw in the warm earth, shaking pine needles from his coat") to reduce wordiness and keep cadence nimble.

- Change "Wolf measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage." to something more active and concise that reinforces the Wolf's patient calculation (e.g., "He measured the sun on the shingles—time enough before Red could reach the cottage.").

- Shorten the hedge/witness list to remove redundancy: replace "no hound, no hunter, no neighbor" with "no hound, no hunter" (neighbors feel unnecessary here).

- Clarify antecedent where needed: in "the iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word" make explicit that the latch is Grandmother's latch to avoid possible ambiguity (e.g., "Grandmother's iron latch glowed faint...").

- Soften or specify "Behind closed teeth he rehearsed the cadence he would wear." Consider replacing with a brief wolf-voice sample or a hint of his theatrical manner (one short line in his voice) to keep the writer's quirks alive and show rather than tell (e.g., add: ' "Such a charming hood," he murmured to himself, testing the shape of the lie.').

- Remove passive or redundant modifiers that slow rhythm ("would be time" → "time"; "checked the hedge and the path for witnesses" → "scanned hedge and path for witnesses") to preserve the Wolf's sleekness.

- Ensure the final sentence leads directly into the doorway action: end the paragraph with the Wolf padding to the doorstep and listening to the room's tiny sounds—keep that as the closing image so the touch-point is the dominant takeaway.
