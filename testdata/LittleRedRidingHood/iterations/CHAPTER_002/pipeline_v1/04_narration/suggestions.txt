- Replace pronouns that could be ambiguous with the character name: change "He pauses..." and "He notes..." and "He smooths..." to "The Wolf pauses...", "The Wolf notes...", "The Wolf smooths..." (keep consistent use of "The Wolf" throughout).

- Remove the filler "Now," at the start of the sentence "Now, suggest..." (this appears in the instructions block — ignore if not part of the narrative). If you meant the narrative: delete the standalone "Now," before "He smooths..." to tighten flow.

- Remove or soften any words that sound archaic or slip into a different register: change "Thyme and cabbage brush his fur" to "Thyme and cabbage brush The Wolf's fur" (keeps clarity and matches the recommended character-name usage).

- Reduce minor repetition of clock/beats imagery to keep the scene crisp: consider deleting either "the slow metronome of the clock" or "counts the clock's beats against his own breaths" — keep one strong clock image.

- Make the sensory focus consistent: specify the source of culinary scent (bread and jam) as "basket" only if you intend to foreshadow it; otherwise, remove "testing the air for bread and jam" or rephrase to "testing the air for any scent of bread and jam" to emphasize absence.

- Clarify the kettle/teacup detail so it doesn't imply another actor is present: change "finding only the kettle's soft breath threading through the door seams. A teacup on its saucer waits by a chair; a hairline crack glints when a cloud shifts." to a single line that ties the domestic details to emptiness, e.g. "He finds only the kettle's soft breath at the door seams and a lone teacup on its saucer; a hairline crack glints when a cloud shifts."

- Tighten the final sentence for intent and tension: condense "measures the latch's height, and readies himself for the sound that will open this particular threshold" to "measures the latch's height and readies himself for the sound that will open the door." (makes the action more immediate and avoids awkward phrasing "this particular threshold").

- Check for any stray pronouns elsewhere in the manuscript that start paragraphs with "They" or "She/He" and apply the same replace-with-name rule to keep references unambiguous.
