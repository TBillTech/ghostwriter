Text: The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock.

Ordered bullets
===============
* wolf arrives first, having NOT taken the deer track that Red is following.
* No figure in a Red Hood appears on the lane; the path beyond the gate lies empty.
* The garden holds stillness broken only by bees and the far, steady tick of an unseen clock.
* The herb beds brush his fur with thyme scent, a cover for any stray musk he carries.
* wolf pauses among thyme and cabbages, testing the air for bread and jam but catching only mint and ash.
* The kettle’s soft breath threads through the door seams, marking a household at ease.
* The cottage windows stand small and clean, with curtains that barely stir.
* The Teacup on Saucer rests by a chair draped with a shawl, a hairline crack glinting when a cloud shifts.
* The hazel Walking Stick leans by the jamb inside, visible through the crack where the door meets the frame.
* The sun-bleached Cottage Door-Latch shows thumb-smooth metal, warmed by afternoon light.
* The clock inside keeps a slow metronome that wolf counts against his own breaths.
* He pads from shadow to sill, placing paws between creaking boards of the step.
* He notes the hinge pins bright where often used, predicting a quiet swing if lifted as the latch falls.
* He studies the latch’s height and the rhythm of familiar knocks that would win it open.
* wolf smooths his throat to shape a borrowed civility, preparing cadence and pause without sound.
* With the garden listening and the clock steady, wolf closes the last steps to the door.

=== RESPONSE ===
The Wolf arrived first, having left the deer track where Red would later wander; beyond the gate the lane lay empty, no bright hood anywhere on the winding path. The garden held its breath—still save for bees and the far, steady tick of an unseen clock—and thyme and cabbages brushed against the Wolf's fur like a soft accusation, carrying mint and ash that hid whatever stray musk the Wolf brought with him. He paused among the herbs, testing the air for bread and jam and finding only the kettle's soft breath threading through the door seams, the sound of a household at ease. The cottage windows were small and clean, curtains barely stirring; a teacup on its saucer waited by a chair draped with Grandmother's shawl, a hairline crack glinting when a cloud shifted. Through the narrow crack where door met frame the walking stick leaned by the jamb—hazel, polished by years of palms—and the sun-bleached latch on the door showed thumb-worn iron, warm from afternoon light.

The clock inside kept its slow metronome and the Wolf counted its beats against his own breaths as he padded from shadow to sill, placing careful paws between the creaking boards of the step. He noted the hinge pins bright with use and pictured the quiet swing that would follow if the latch fell; he measured the latch's height and memorized the rhythm of familiar knocks that would open this particular threshold. The Wolf smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, shaping a borrowed civility—cadence and pause formed without sound—and with the garden listening and the clock steady he closed the last steps to the cottage door.
