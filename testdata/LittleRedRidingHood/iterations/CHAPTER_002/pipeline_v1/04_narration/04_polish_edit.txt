# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf stands in the gardenâ€™s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock. Beyond the gate the lane lies empty, no bright hood on the winding path. Thyme and cabbages brush his fur, masking whatever stray musk he brings. He pauses among the herbs, testing the air for bread and jam and finding only the kettle's soft breath threading through the door seams. A teacup on its saucer waits by a chair; a hairline crack glints when a cloud shifts.

The Wolf smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door. The Wolf counts the clock's beats against his own breaths as he moves from shadow to sill, placing careful paws on the creaking step. He notes the walking stick by the jamb and the sun-bleached, thumb-worn latch, measures the latch's height, and readies himself for the sound that will open this particular threshold.

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.
