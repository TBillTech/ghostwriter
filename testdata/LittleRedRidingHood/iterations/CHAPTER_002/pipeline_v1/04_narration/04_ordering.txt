=== SYSTEM ===
You will order and refine brainstormed bullet points for coherent flow.

=== USER ===
You are a director examining the output of a creative brainstorming session, also working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is simply to order the bullets in the most logial sequence possible. You are not allowed to take bullets away.
You are however, allowed to add new intermediate bullets to help the sequence make more sense.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:


# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'At the Cottage Gate', 'description': 'Having slipped from the deer track ahead of Red, the Wolf reaches a small cottage tucked in thyme and smoke.\nThe garden is a patchwork of herbs and cabbages, the door sun-bleached and simple; inside, a kettle hums and an old clock ticks.\nThe world here smells of mint and ash and rest, vulnerable in its quiet routine.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Cottage Door-Latch', 'significance': 'Threshold of trust; a simple defense turned invitation', 'description': 'A thumb-worn iron latch, warm from afternoon light.\nIt answers to a familiar knock and an even more familiar voice.\n'}, {'name': 'Hearth and Kettle', 'significance': 'Homeliness to be imitated; cover for small sounds', 'description': 'A blackened iron kettle keeps time in soft breaths over banked coals,\nits steam sewing the room together with the smell of nettle tea.\n'}, {'name': 'Teacup on Saucer', 'significance': 'Grandmother’s pause interrupted', 'description': 'Porcelain with a hairline crack, rim blushed by tea.\nIt waits beside a chair draped with a shawl.\n'}, {'name': 'Walking Stick', 'significance': 'Measure of frailty the Wolf will exploit', 'description': 'A hazel stick, polished by years of palms, leaning by the door.\n'}]}

# Actors

The, Wolf, Grandmother

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide your results as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character.
2. **Clean Lines**: If there are intent words at the beginning of the given bullets, for example "Clarity - ", or "Flavor: " leave those out and just recover the point without a title.
3. **Just Bullets Output**: Strip off, ignore, and do not output any markdown or other formatting, other than just only '*' character at line start.

Now, Here are the Bullets to be ordered in as logical a way as possible:
* The garden holds stillness broken only by bees and the far, steady tick of an unseen clock.
* wolf arrives first, having NOT taken the deer track that Red is following.
* No figure in a Red Hood appears on the lane; the path beyond the gate lies empty.
* wolf pauses among thyme and cabbages, testing the air for bread and jam but catching only mint and ash.
* The cottage windows stand small and clean, with curtains that barely stir.
* The kettle’s soft breath threads through the door seams, marking a household at ease.
* The sun-bleached Cottage Door-Latch shows thumb-smooth metal, warmed by afternoon light.
* The hazel Walking Stick leans by the jamb inside, visible through the crack where the door meets the frame.
* The Teacup on Saucer rests by a chair draped with a shawl, a hairline crack glinting when a cloud shifts.
* The clock inside keeps a slow metronome that wolf counts against his own breaths.
* wolf smooths his throat to shape a borrowed civility, preparing cadence and pause without sound.
* He pads from shadow to sill, placing paws between creaking boards of the step.
* He notes the hinge pins bright where often used, predicting a quiet swing if lifted as the latch falls.
* The herb beds brush his fur with thyme scent, a cover for any stray musk he carries.
* He studies the latch’s height and the rhythm of familiar knocks that would win it open.
* With the garden listening and the clock steady, wolf closes the last steps to the door.
