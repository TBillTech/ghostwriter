=== SYSTEM ===
You are brainstorming narrative beats as concise bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

ALWAYS keep to the facts. Anything that sounds like dialog we will leave for the dialog parts of the story.  We need to generate pure narrative pseudo-historical prose.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:


# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'At the Cottage Gate', 'description': 'Having slipped from the deer track ahead of Red, the Wolf reaches a small cottage tucked in thyme and smoke.\nThe garden is a patchwork of herbs and cabbages, the door sun-bleached and simple; inside, a kettle hums and an old clock ticks.\nThe world here smells of mint and ash and rest, vulnerable in its quiet routine.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Cottage Door-Latch', 'significance': 'Threshold of trust; a simple defense turned invitation', 'description': 'A thumb-worn iron latch, warm from afternoon light.\nIt answers to a familiar knock and an even more familiar voice.\n'}, {'name': 'Hearth and Kettle', 'significance': 'Homeliness to be imitated; cover for small sounds', 'description': 'A blackened iron kettle keeps time in soft breaths over banked coals,\nits steam sewing the room together with the smell of nettle tea.\n'}, {'name': 'Teacup on Saucer', 'significance': 'Grandmother’s pause interrupted', 'description': 'Porcelain with a hairline crack, rim blushed by tea.\nIt waits beside a chair draped with a shawl.\n'}, {'name': 'Walking Stick', 'significance': 'Measure of frailty the Wolf will exploit', 'description': 'A hazel stick, polished by years of palms, leaning by the door.\n'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
The, Wolf, Grandmother

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock.
He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door.



# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.
6. **Format**: Do NOT print any other information besides bullet points starting the line with '*' character.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to give the readers a picture of the environment and what is objectively happning, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real. Leave feelings and opinions for later. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.

=== RESPONSE ===
* The garden holds stillness broken only by bees and the far, steady tick of an unseen clock.
* wolf arrives first, having taken a deer track that cuts the Forest Path’s curve.
* No figure in a Red Hood appears on the lane; the path beyond the gate lies empty.
* wolf pauses among thyme and cabbages, testing the air for bread and jam but catching only mint and ash.
* The cottage windows stand small and clean, with curtains that barely stir.
* The kettle’s soft breath threads through the door seams, marking a household at ease.
* The sun-bleached Cottage Door-Latch shows thumb-smooth metal, warmed by afternoon light.
* The hazel Walking Stick leans by the jamb inside, visible through the crack where the door meets the frame.
* The Teacup on Saucer rests by a chair draped with a shawl, a hairline crack glinting when a cloud shifts.
* The clock inside keeps a slow metronome that wolf counts against his own breaths.
* wolf measures footfalls on the path beyond the hedge and hears none approaching.
* wolf smooths his throat to shape a borrowed civility, preparing cadence and pause without sound.
* He pads from shadow to sill, placing paws between creaking boards of the step.
* He notes the hinge pins bright where often used, predicting a quiet swing if lifted as the latch falls.
* The herb beds brush his fur with thyme scent, a cover for any stray musk he carries.
* He tests a loose bit of gravel with a claw and leaves it set to warn if someone comes behind.
* He tilts an ear toward the chimney draw; the hearth breath will muffle small movements near the door.
* He glances to the lane again, reckoning the lead bought from the shortcut: minutes, not many.
* He studies the latch’s height and the rhythm of familiar knocks that would win it open.
* With the garden listening and the clock steady, wolf closes the last steps to the door.
