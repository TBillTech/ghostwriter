=== SYSTEM ===
You are brainstorming narrative beats as concise bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

ALWAYS keep to the facts. Anything that sounds like dialog we will leave for the dialog parts of the story.  
We need to generate pure narrative pseudo-historical prose.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. From the bramble a sleek wolf moved parallel, low and silent, lifting his muzzle to the trail as if to taste the drift of jam, and when Red paused he slid into speech with a velvet, honeyed voice that asked where she was bound and what treasures she carried, murmuring of a quicker way and offering to guide her by a narrow deer track that would rejoin the lane by the birch marked by a lightning scar; the forest listened—a jay cackled and vanished, a branch brushed the basket and made it creak, and shadows lengthened while the wolf's smile was all bright teeth and false comfort. He named the crooked stump and the three tall pines that marked her grandmother's cottage and, soft and insistent, assured her the deer track would set her right on time, letting the thought of a shortcut curl in the air like a lure. Red tightened her hood, fingers clamped the handles, felt the crooked stump's shadow skitter across her boots, and though she faltered at the fork and felt the hush press, she remembered her grandmother waiting, thanked him in a small voice, and—resolute not to linger for flowers—accepted the wolf’s guidance, stepping onto the narrow ruts and hurrying away along the hidden track.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines. The hood gleams in narrow bands of light as the path winds past the black-barked oak and the forest draws a shade around me; pine needles soften my steps and pale dust lifts in my wake while a tuft of blue flowers nods from the verge. I clutch the wicker when a branch brushes it and the crooked stump's shadow skitters over my boots, and when the wolf slips from the bramble his voice is velvet and his questions smell of honey and quicksilver. He asks where I'm bound, what treasures I carry, and offers a hushed shortcut along a deer track that will meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar—names I know, and promises that curl like a lure. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows make me flinch; still, thinking of Grandmother waiting with bread and jam, I tug my hood tighter, decide against lingering for flowers, and with a tightened grip on the basket and a small, steady stride I accept the deer track and hurry on, thanking him and calling farewell over my shoulder.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sit easy beneath my coat as I pad low through the bramble, smelling jam like an invitation threaded through the pines, watching her bright hood cut the light and the wicker creak like a small, honest drum. I slip between shadows and time my words soft as oil, letting polite curiosity tilt her answers toward the map I want to set in her head: three tall pines, the crooked stump, the birch with the lightning scar. I purr a promise of a quicker way, let the sibilants smear like a ribbon, and watch the branch that brushes her hand make the basket speak for me. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows do my work for me; hesitation blooms, memory of the birch tugs, and I press the deer-track into her choices like an easy route home. She tightens her hood, thanks me in a small voice, and follows the narrow ruts, fingers curled on the handle—I bow with a silk of a smile and wait, patient as hunger.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums and walks beneath my pines, the hood bright against the deepening shade where the black oak bends the trail. Tufted blue leans in my verge and pine needles hush her steps while a branch reaches to make the wicker creak; I let the sound fold into my long quiet. A sleek shape slips through my bramble, low and measured, tasting the jam that rides my air, and his voice slides over my understory like oil—soft questions, the offer of a narrow deer track that threads beneath my roots and promises to meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar. The jay cackles and then the hush thickens, the crooked stump's shadow slides across her boots, and she pauses between my forks before tugging her hood tighter and stepping onto the thin ruts. I keep the crossing tucked in my soil as she hurries on, basket against her arm, the trail folding the moment into the long hush of the wood.

Here is the scene the actors are placed in:
{'name': 'At the Cottage Gate', 'description': 'Having slipped from the deer track ahead of Red, the Wolf reaches a small cottage tucked in thyme and smoke.\nThe garden is a patchwork of herbs and cabbages, the door sun-bleached and simple; inside, a kettle hums and an old clock ticks.\nThe world here smells of mint and ash and rest, vulnerable in its quiet routine.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Cottage Door-Latch', 'significance': 'Threshold of trust; a simple defense turned invitation', 'description': 'A thumb-worn iron latch, warm from afternoon light.\nIt answers to a familiar knock and an even more familiar voice.\n'}, {'name': 'Hearth and Kettle', 'significance': 'Homeliness to be imitated; cover for small sounds', 'description': 'A blackened iron kettle keeps time in soft breaths over banked coals,\nits steam sewing the room together with the smell of nettle tea.\n'}, {'name': 'Teacup on Saucer', 'significance': 'Grandmother’s pause interrupted', 'description': 'Porcelain with a hairline crack, rim blushed by tea.\nIt waits beside a chair draped with a shawl.\n'}, {'name': 'Walking Stick', 'significance': 'Measure of frailty the Wolf will exploit', 'description': 'A hazel stick, polished by years of palms, leaning by the door.\n'}]}

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; this is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock.
He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting each line with an '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown. Do NOT use nested bullets or dashes.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by their `id` field from the setting.
3. **Touch-Point**: Express this moment clearly and concretely; the key action should be visible to the reader (“on camera”), not merely implied.
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To" so that events and logic align with prior context.
5. **Scenes**: You should depict action directly when appropriate. Use sound, motion, rhythm, and consequence to convey the event.
6. **Tone**: Write in the manner of a classic fairytale, cinematic myth, or entertaining space opera — swift, sometimes symbolic, and dwell on implications instead of graphic detail. Focus on transformation, and atmosphere.
7. **Style**: Keep sentences concise and vivid. Each bullet should contribute one clear beat of story progression or imagery.
8. **Format**: Output only bullet points beginning with '*', with no headings or commentary.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to give the readers a picture of the environment and what is objectively happening, with the goal of building upon and making the Touch-Point real. Leave feelings and opinions for later. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution (but do not make this explicit).


=== RESPONSE ===
* wolf pauses among thyme and cabbages; the garden holds steady in bees and warm smoke.
* He listens toward the lane; no footfall, no red hood at the gate, only the slow clock inside.
* He scents nettle tea and ash; the kettle’s breath threads the air from the chimney.
* He measures the sun on the shingles; there is time before red hood could reach the cottage.
* He checks the hedge and the path for witnesses; no dog, no hunter, no neighboring voice.
* He presses one paw to the warm dirt and shakes pine needles from his coat.
* He settles his breathing to the clock’s tick, shaping his throat for borrowed civility.
* He steps through mint and thyme without stirring more than the bees.
* He studies the door’s thumb-worn iron; the latch glows faintly with afternoon heat.
* He tilts an ear to the wood; inside, the kettle hums and floorboards creak once in the quiet.
* He notes the hazel walking stick’s shadow through the sill gap, leaning by the door.
* He aligns his weight for upright reach; claws withdrawn, pads ready for the latch.
* He rehearses a familiar cadence behind closed teeth; his voice readied like a sheathed blade.
* He positions his body to shield the threshold from the lane’s view.
* He taps the door in a gentle, known rhythm the latch expects.
* He lifts the iron with a careful, noiseless draw, testing the give without a scrape.
* He waits a heartbeat for answer within; the clock counts the pause.
* He angles his muzzle to the jamb and lets a softened breath carry his prepared tone through the seam.
* He listens again; a chair’s shawl whispers, and the kettle answers with a longer sigh.
* Finding no alarm raised, he sets his paw to the latch once more and begins to ease the door toward him.
