=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Wolf (testing): "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
Wolf (again, higher, kinder): "Oh, what a day you must have had."
The words fit. He settles deeper into the quilt.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
Narrator: You watch the shutter hook hold as daylight thins to a pewter wash that smooths edges and fattens shadows.

wolf: You step over the threshold; you are told to mind the step.

Narrator: You pause with him as he listens for how the boards carry the words, testing whether the sibilants snag.

wolf: You are welcomed again, softer now, the smile pressed small behind a pair of spectacles and you are reminded to mind the step.

wolf: You are observed as he says you must have had quite a day.

Narrator: You feel the line float and fall; he nudges it higher, letting a thin tremble lace the edges like ribbon.

wolf: You hear the words higher, kinder, the tone lifting with a breathy chuckle stitched to the end as if to soothe you.

Narrator: You notice powder prickling his nose; he swallows the urge to sneeze and smooths the nightcap over pinched ears so you do not see.

Narrator: You see him settle deeper into the quilt, weight sinking until the puff holds him and the hem swallows his breadth.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
Narrator: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
wolf: You notice the pewter light tighten the world into a corridor and feel how the hush beneath the trees makes footsteps announce themselves.
Narrator: You register the pause and listen for the way the boards might answer, waiting for any snag of sound.
wolf: You feel the welcome as if folded into fabric—small, deliberate, the cord tightened so it won't slip—and you watch how minding a single step can shape the room.
wolf: You catch yourself cataloguing the lift in the line, how the assertion of a hard day settles like a pebble into the conversation.
Narrator: You let the rhythm of the words rise and fall in your marrow, noting the deliberate pitch and the ribboned tremor that frames the sentence.
wolf: You take the kinder higher note as a softening touch, as if the chuckle at the end were an attempt to iron the seams of worry flat.
Narrator: You see the sudden, private irritation prick him—an itch stifled, a nose smoothed beneath a cap so the small disorder remains unseen.
Narrator: You feel the slow give of weight as the quilt takes tension and the hem swallows breadth, and you watch the small surrender of posture to comfort.
