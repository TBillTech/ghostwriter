The Wolf practiced. "Come in, dear heart; mind the sssstep," he said, shaping the syllables like a soft instrument. Inside, the disguise settles like a veil; the kettle's steam turns the air into a quiet theater. He hissed again, "Do come in, dear heart, and tread softly; mind the sssstep."

He softened his voice. "Oh, what a day you must have had." He coaxed, "Put the basket down, dear; bread needs its rest too." Between the lines the room quiets, the kettle hisses softly, and a plan takes shape.

"Long path, was it? The pines murmur back, as if woodsmoke clings to your tired feet," he murmured, letting the words curl around the imagined visitor. The kettle's steam thins as the exchange grows intimate, a quiet rhythm guiding the pace. He feigned distraction. "Forgive my prattle, dear dove; come closer, for these old ears aren't what they used to be."

He repeated the invitation like a litany. "Come in, dear heart, softly now; let the grandmother's shape guide my tongue." He rumbled the last line with a false impatience meant to hurryâ€”"Grandmother will be grateful if you hurry inside; she does not like to wait." The voice settles back into the room, and with each practiced note the wolf becomes less predator and more pleading elder, his teeth hidden behind the well-worn cadence of someone eager for company.
