* [Clarity] wolf is practicing grandmother’s voice, testing pitch and sweetness.
* [Clarity] The words “Come in, dear heart. Mind the step.” are rehearsal, not greeting; the door is still closed.
* [Flavor] wolf, higher, kindly: Come in, dear heart. Mind the sssstep.
* [Flavor] wolf, again, softer, with a dry practice cough: Oh, what a day you must have had.
* [Flavor] wolf, coaxing: Set down your basket, dear. Bread grows tired, too.
* [Flavor] wolf, matching the visitor’s imagined breath: Long path, was it? All the pine needles chatting at your heels?
* [Flavor] A modest, practiced cough slips into the steam from the kettle, sounding small and domestic.
* [Flavor] wolf, playful, then tender: Oh, listen to me prattling. Come closer, dove—my ears aren’t what they were.
* [Flavor] He repeats the imagined answer under his breath, softening it, teaching his mouth the shape of grandmother’s replies.
* [Flavor] wolf, with a low growl tucked away at the end: Grandmother will be ever so grateful if you don’t keep her waiting.
