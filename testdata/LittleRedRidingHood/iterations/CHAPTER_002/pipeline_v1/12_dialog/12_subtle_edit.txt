# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
Wolf (testing): "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
Wolf (again, higher, kinder): "Oh, what a day you must have had."
The words fit. He settles deeper into the quilt.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The Wolf practiced. "Come in, dear heart; mind the sssstep," he said, shaping the syllables like a soft instrument. Inside, the disguise settles like a veil; the kettle's steam turns the air into a quiet theater. He hissed again, "Do come in, dear heart, and tread softly; mind the sssstep."

He softened his voice. "Oh, what a day you must have had." He coaxed, "Put the basket down, dear; bread needs its rest too." Between the lines the room quiets, the kettle hisses softly, and a plan takes shape.

"Long path, was it? The pines murmur back, as if woodsmoke clings to your tired feet," he murmured, letting the words curl around the imagined visitor. The kettle's steam thins as the exchange grows intimate, a quiet rhythm guiding the pace. He feigned distraction. "Forgive my prattle, dear dove; come closer, for these old ears aren't what they used to be."

He repeated the invitation like a litany. "Come in, dear heart, softly now; let the grandmother's shape guide my tongue." He rumbled the last line with a false impatience meant to hurry—"Grandmother will be grateful if you hurry inside; she does not like to wait." The voice settles back into the room, and with each practiced note the wolf becomes less predator and more pleading elder, his teeth hidden behind the well-worn cadence of someone eager for company.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove the repeated, nearly identical "Come in, dear heart; mind the sssstep" lines. Keep a single, clear instance using the exact touch-point phrasing: "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step." (no extra sibilant repetition).
- Replace "He softened his voice. 'Oh, what a day you must have had.' He coaxed, 'Put the basket down, dear; bread needs its rest too.'" with direct spoken lines only. Example: Wolf: "Oh, what a day you must have had. Put the basket down, dear — the bread needs its rest." Remove the narration tag "He softened his voice" and "He coaxed."
- Delete or condense long prose-stage descriptions embedded in the dialog (e.g., "Inside, the disguise settles like a veil; the kettle's steam turns the air into a quiet theater." and "Between the lines the room quiets, the kettle hisses softly, and a plan takes shape."). If stage-setting is needed, convert to a single brief stage direction outside dialog: [kettle hisses softly].
- Remove the overly poetic and literal simile "shaping the syllables like a soft instrument." If you want a hint of artifice, have a short line: Wolf: "Listen—" followed by the touch-point line.
- Cut the stilted, redundant lines "Do come in, dear heart, and tread softly; mind the sssstep." and "He hissed again..." (they repeat earlier content). Keep invitations concise and varied only once.
- Replace "Long path, was it? The pines murmur back, as if woodsmoke clings to your tired feet," with a simpler, character-appropriate line: Wolf: "Long path, was it? You must be tired from the pines." Remove the heavy metaphor "woodsmoke clings..."
- Remove "The kettle's steam thins as the exchange grows intimate, a quiet rhythm guiding the pace." and similar narration. If rhythm is important, show it in short lines or pauses: e.g., ellipses or brief stage direction: [pause].
- Delete "Forgive my prattle, dear dove; come closer, for these old ears aren't what they used to be." Replace with a more natural phrase and keep modest repetition out: Wolf: "Forgive my prattle — come closer, my ears aren't what they were."
- Remove "He repeated the invitation like a litany." and the following litany-style repeated invitation. Instead, present one clear invitation and then move to the second required touch-point line or a small, different remark.
- Replace "let the grandmother's shape guide my tongue" (awkward and meta) with a natural, in-character cue: Wolf: "Speak up for Grandmother, won't you?" or simply omit.
- Cut the final summary narration ("The voice settles back into the room... his teeth hidden behind the well-worn cadence...") — keep only one short line that reveals intent through speech, not description. Example: Wolf (softly): "Grandmother will be grateful if you hurry inside; she does not like to wait." (make this a single, brief spoken line).
- Ensure the two required touch-point lines appear verbatim and naturally placed:
  - "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
  - "Oh, what a day you must have had."
- Overall: convert remaining stage prose into minimal stage directions bracketed outside speech, keep dialogue lines short and natural, remove repeated invitations and ornate metaphors, and avoid characters describing their own performance.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.
