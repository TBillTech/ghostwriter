=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Wolf (testing): "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
Wolf (again, higher, kinder): "Oh, what a day you must have had."
The words fit. He settles deeper into the quilt.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You practice grandmother’s voice, testing pitch and sweetness as if tuning a fragile instrument.

Narrator: The words “Come in, dear heart. Mind the step.” are rehearsal, not a greeting; you are still behind the closed door.

wolf: You lift your tone higher, kindly, and hiss the s slightly longer: Come in, dear heart. Mind the sssstep.

wolf: You soften, clear your throat like a dry kettle, and say with practiced warmth: Oh, what a day you must have had.

wolf: You coax, gentle and insistent: Set down your basket, dear. Bread grows tired, too.

Narrator: You imagine the visitor’s breath and let your voice mirror it—matching tempo and small fatigue.

wolf: You murmur, attentive to the imagined path: Long path, was it? All the pine needles chatting at your heels?

Narrator: A modest, practiced cough slips into the steam from the kettle, sounding small and domestic as you time it.

wolf: You play at forgetful tenderness, then fold into it: Oh, listen to me prattling. Come closer, dove—my ears aren’t what they were.

wolf: You repeat the imagined answer under your breath, softening each syllable so your mouth learns the grandmother’s shape.

wolf: You finish with a low, careful rumble, a growl tucked away like a bad habit: Grandmother will be ever so grateful if you don’t keep her waiting.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Narrator: You note the line is a rehearsal, not a welcome, and picture fingers still on the other side of the door.
wolf: You register the sharper s like a needle, and imagine the petulant little hiss will make the visitor lean in.
wolf: You feel the kinder tone and the dry kettle throat as if testing whether warmth will bridge distance.
wolf: You sense the coaxing insistence in the request and measure how heavy the basket must seem to the hands that carry it.
Narrator: You mirror a breath you do not hear, pacing your cadence to match imagined fatigue.
wolf: You pick up on the imagined path's gossip and let the line taste of late woodsmoke and small, tired steps.
Narrator: You hear the soft domestic cough and note how perfectly ordinary it makes an otherwise strange voice.
wolf: You catch the practiced forgetfulness and let the invitation tighten like a thread around attention.
wolf: You feel the repeated, soft rehearsal of the reply and let each softened syllable teach the shape of an old mouth.
wolf: You hear the final rumble, the gratitude wrapped with an edge, and feel the implied urgency beneath the civility.
