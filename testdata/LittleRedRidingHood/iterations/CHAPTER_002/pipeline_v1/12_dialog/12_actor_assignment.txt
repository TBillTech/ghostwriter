=== SYSTEM ===
Assign dialog lines to actors as 'id: line' entries.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Wolf (testing): "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
Wolf (again, higher, kinder): "Oh, what a day you must have had."
The words fit. He settles deeper into the quilt.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* [Clarity] wolf is practicing grandmother’s voice, testing pitch and sweetness.
* [Clarity] The words “Come in, dear heart. Mind the step.” are rehearsal, not greeting; the door is still closed.
* [Flavor] wolf, higher, kindly: Come in, dear heart. Mind the sssstep.
* [Flavor] wolf, again, softer, with a dry practice cough: Oh, what a day you must have had.
* [Flavor] wolf, coaxing: Set down your basket, dear. Bread grows tired, too.
* [Flavor] wolf, matching the visitor’s imagined breath: Long path, was it? All the pine needles chatting at your heels?
* [Flavor] A modest, practiced cough slips into the steam from the kettle, sounding small and domestic.
* [Flavor] wolf, playful, then tender: Oh, listen to me prattling. Come closer, dove—my ears aren’t what they were.
* [Flavor] He repeats the imagined answer under his breath, softening it, teaching his mouth the shape of grandmother’s replies.
* [Flavor] wolf, with a low growl tucked away at the end: Grandmother will be ever so grateful if you don’t keep her waiting.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You practice grandmother’s voice, testing pitch and sweetness as if tuning a fragile instrument.

Narrator: The words “Come in, dear heart. Mind the step.” are rehearsal, not a greeting; you are still behind the closed door.

wolf: You lift your tone higher, kindly, and hiss the s slightly longer: Come in, dear heart. Mind the sssstep.

wolf: You soften, clear your throat like a dry kettle, and say with practiced warmth: Oh, what a day you must have had.

wolf: You coax, gentle and insistent: Set down your basket, dear. Bread grows tired, too.

Narrator: You imagine the visitor’s breath and let your voice mirror it—matching tempo and small fatigue.

wolf: You murmur, attentive to the imagined path: Long path, was it? All the pine needles chatting at your heels?

Narrator: A modest, practiced cough slips into the steam from the kettle, sounding small and domestic as you time it.

wolf: You play at forgetful tenderness, then fold into it: Oh, listen to me prattling. Come closer, dove—my ears aren’t what they were.

wolf: You repeat the imagined answer under your breath, softening each syllable so your mouth learns the grandmother’s shape.

wolf: You finish with a low, careful rumble, a growl tucked away like a bad habit: Grandmother will be ever so grateful if you don’t keep her waiting.
