# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf practiced.
[kettle hisses softly]
Wolf: "Listen—"
Wolf: "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."

Wolf: "Oh, what a day you must have had. Put the basket down, dear — the bread needs its rest."

Wolf: "Long path, was it? You must be tired from the pines."
[pause]
Wolf: "Forgive my prattle — come closer, my ears aren't what they were."

Wolf (softly): "Grandmother will be grateful if you hurry inside; she does not like to wait."

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.

=== RESPONSE ===
The Wolf practiced. The kettle hissed softly.

"Listen—" he said.

"Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."

"Oh, what a day you must have had. Put the basket down, dear — the bread needs its rest."

"Long path, was it? You must be tired from the pines." He paused. "Forgive my prattle — come closer, my ears aren't what they were."

Softly, he added, "Grandmother will be grateful if you hurry inside; she does not like to wait."
