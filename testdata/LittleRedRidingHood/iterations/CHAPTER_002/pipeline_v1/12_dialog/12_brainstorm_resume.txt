=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm dialog beats as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
Wolf set the tipped chair upright with a careful paw; the scrape across the creaking boards was brief, like a thing remembered and forgiven. He squared the rug at the bed’s foot, brushed the heel scuffs near the door with the side of a paw as if erasing footprints from a page, then folded the scattered shawl once and drew it about his shoulders so the outline softened. The fallen teacup was righted on its saucer; with the cuff of the shawl’s edge he wiped a faint ring of tea from the table until the wood looked tended. Each motion tidied the impression of struggle to nothing. He settled the kettle back on the hook above the coals and set it to murmur, nudging the embers until a low sound began beneath the lid. The hearth answered his coaxing with a steady, kept glow, turning the room into a kept secret. He snapped the powder tin shut and hid it beneath the washstand. Wolf pushed the spectacles higher on his snout until the smudge hid the shine of his eyes, and he left the shutter hook fast so the lamp made corners kinder, blurrier.

Wolf shook the feather quilt once to loosen the crease of struggle, smoothed it flat across the bed, and drew the curtains to a half-closed drape that framed a small, resting silhouette. In the mirror’s dim, Wolf’s mouth learned a smaller smile. He tried on a cough the way one tries on a glove: dry, modest, tested once, then again until the third sat ordinary and harmless. At last he settled into the pillows, sinking until the quilt erased his breadth and left only the gentle rise where a head ought to be.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Inside, the Disguise', 'description': 'The aftermath of swallowing Grandma: The chair is knocked over, and the teapot is still warm.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Grandmother’s Nightcap and Spectacles', 'significance': 'Tools of disguise; innocence repurposed', 'description': 'A soft cap with a blue ribbon, and spectacles smudged with use.\nThey pinch the Wolf’s ears and blur his eyes, but lend him a silhouette.\n'}, {'name': 'Feather Quilt and Bed Curtains', 'significance': 'Stage for the masquerade', 'description': 'A puffed quilt stitched with strawberries, curtains that turn a bed into a small theater.\nThey muffle size and shape, smooth the outline of teeth.\n'}, {'name': 'Shutter Hook', 'significance': 'Conspiracy with the dark', 'description': 'A simple hook-and-eye that tames daylight.\nOnce fastened, the room agrees to keep secrets.\n'}, {'name': 'Powder Tin', 'significance': 'A trick to soften a snout', 'description': 'A little tin of rice powder; a dab on the muzzle keeps the fur from gleaming.\n'}]}

The, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
Wolf (testing): "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
Wolf (again, higher, kinder): "Oh, what a day you must have had."
The words fit. He settles deeper into the quilt.



# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative lines to give the readers clarity and flavor, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.

=== RESPONSE ===
* [Clarity] The room is dim; the shutter hook is fastened and the lamp makes the corners soft.
* [Clarity] The kettle murmurs; the teapot’s warmth implies recent company.
* [Clarity] The bed curtains are half-drawn; a small silhouette appears where grandmother should be.
* [Clarity] The nightcap and spectacles rest on wolf; the spectacles are slightly smudged.

* [Clarity] wolf plans to coax the visitor to approach the bed, not to linger at the threshold.
* [Clarity] wolf is listening for footsteps on the forest path and the pause before a knock.

* [Flavor] wolf, higher, kindly: Come in, dear heart. Mind the sssstep.
* [Flavor] wolf, again, softer, with a dry practice cough: Oh, what a day you must have had.
* [Flavor] A fingertip of rice powder blurs the snout’s shine; wolf lifts his head, tests the spectacles’ pinch, and lets his smile shrink to something grandmother-small.
* [Flavor] wolf, feigned fussing: The latch always sticks, lamb. There—push with your hip.
* [Flavor] wolf, polite veneer: Your hood—does it keep you warm? Sssuch a bright thing in all this pine.
* [Flavor] He counts the kettle’s little sighs as if they were footfalls, timing his next line to the last sigh before silence.
* [Flavor] wolf, coaxing: Set down your basket, dear. Bread grows tired, too.
* [Flavor] wolf, matching the visitor’s imagined breath: Long path, was it? All the pine needles chatting at your heels?
* [Flavor] The quilt’s strawberry stitching hides a broad chest; wolf presses flatter, feeling the bed’s give and the role settle.
* [Flavor] wolf, light, concerned: Mind the sssill by the hearth—your toes, child. I worry for you; let me help.
* [Flavor] A modest, practiced cough slips into the steam from the kettle, sounding small and domestic.
* [Flavor] wolf, playful, then tender: Oh, listen to me prattling. Come closer, dove—my ears aren’t what they were.
* [Flavor] He repeats the imagined answer under his breath, softening it, teaching his mouth the shape of grandmother’s replies.
* [Flavor] wolf, with a low chuckle tucked away at the end: Grandmother will be ever so grateful if you don’t keep her waiting.
* [Flavor] The floorboard near the door creaks; wolf’s eyes dim behind the smudge on the lenses, letting kindness do the shining.
* [Flavor] wolf, mildly winded on purpose: Mind the step—yes, that one. There we are. Good girl.
* [Flavor] He smooths the quilt edge once more, tidying a rebellious corner as if tidying his story to match his voice.
* [Flavor] wolf, murmured assurance: The curtains make a little theater of it, don’t they? Come take your bow by me, sweet.
