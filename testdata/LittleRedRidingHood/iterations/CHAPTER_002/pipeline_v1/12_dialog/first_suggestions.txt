- Remove the repeated, nearly identical "Come in, dear heart; mind the sssstep" lines. Keep a single, clear instance using the exact touch-point phrasing: "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step." (no extra sibilant repetition).
- Replace "He softened his voice. 'Oh, what a day you must have had.' He coaxed, 'Put the basket down, dear; bread needs its rest too.'" with direct spoken lines only. Example: Wolf: "Oh, what a day you must have had. Put the basket down, dear — the bread needs its rest." Remove the narration tag "He softened his voice" and "He coaxed."
- Delete or condense long prose-stage descriptions embedded in the dialog (e.g., "Inside, the disguise settles like a veil; the kettle's steam turns the air into a quiet theater." and "Between the lines the room quiets, the kettle hisses softly, and a plan takes shape."). If stage-setting is needed, convert to a single brief stage direction outside dialog: [kettle hisses softly].
- Remove the overly poetic and literal simile "shaping the syllables like a soft instrument." If you want a hint of artifice, have a short line: Wolf: "Listen—" followed by the touch-point line.
- Cut the stilted, redundant lines "Do come in, dear heart, and tread softly; mind the sssstep." and "He hissed again..." (they repeat earlier content). Keep invitations concise and varied only once.
- Replace "Long path, was it? The pines murmur back, as if woodsmoke clings to your tired feet," with a simpler, character-appropriate line: Wolf: "Long path, was it? You must be tired from the pines." Remove the heavy metaphor "woodsmoke clings..."
- Remove "The kettle's steam thins as the exchange grows intimate, a quiet rhythm guiding the pace." and similar narration. If rhythm is important, show it in short lines or pauses: e.g., ellipses or brief stage direction: [pause].
- Delete "Forgive my prattle, dear dove; come closer, for these old ears aren't what they used to be." Replace with a more natural phrase and keep modest repetition out: Wolf: "Forgive my prattle — come closer, my ears aren't what they were."
- Remove "He repeated the invitation like a litany." and the following litany-style repeated invitation. Instead, present one clear invitation and then move to the second required touch-point line or a small, different remark.
- Replace "let the grandmother's shape guide my tongue" (awkward and meta) with a natural, in-character cue: Wolf: "Speak up for Grandmother, won't you?" or simply omit.
- Cut the final summary narration ("The voice settles back into the room... his teeth hidden behind the well-worn cadence...") — keep only one short line that reveals intent through speech, not description. Example: Wolf (softly): "Grandmother will be grateful if you hurry inside; she does not like to wait." (make this a single, brief spoken line).
- Ensure the two required touch-point lines appear verbatim and naturally placed:
  - "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
  - "Oh, what a day you must have had."
- Overall: convert remaining stage prose into minimal stage directions bracketed outside speech, keep dialogue lines short and natural, remove repeated invitations and ornate metaphors, and avoid characters describing their own performance.
