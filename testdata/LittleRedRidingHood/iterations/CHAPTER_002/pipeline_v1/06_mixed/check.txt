=== SYSTEM ===
You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning, warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney. He pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat. Nettle and wood smoke rose from Grandmother's kettle. Wolf listened toward the lane: no footfall, no Red yet, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door.

Wolf measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage. Wolf checked the hedge and the path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter, no neighbor. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath. He padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room’s tiny sounds, and studied the thumb-worn latch; the iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. Behind closed teeth he rehearsed the cadence he would wear.

---

He knocked once.

"Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Grandmother (muffled): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Wolf, Grandmother

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
The latch clicked. Somewhere inside, the kettle sighed. Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway; the moment held, equal parts invitation and caution.

Wolf paused, whiskers twitching. "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?"

Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold."

The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known, and the room altered its breath to meet it. Mint-scented air held an unasked question.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Delete or trim one of the near-duplicate scent lines: choose either "Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway" or "Mint-scented air held an unasked question." Keep the stronger image (recommend the first) and reduce redundancy.

- Make Wolf’s spoken line lean more toward his established cadence: change "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?" to something sleeker and more coaxing (e.g., shorten, add elongated sibilants, and fold in a subtle suggestion of control). Example direction: cut to one crisp compliment, then a leading question that narrows choices.

- Add a tiny physical beat to Wolf’s approach to ground the dialogue: show him pausing with a paw on the latch or fingers (wolf’s paw) brushing the doorframe—this will connect his vocal manipulation to an actionable intention and foreshadow the click.

- Soften/ground Grandmother’s line to fit her hearth-tone and frailty. Replace "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold." with a homelier, gentler admonition (e.g., "Mind the latch, dear—there's a little chill today; warm yourself by the fire.") Keep it short but less directive and more loving.

- Trim the purple wording "The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known" — it reads heavy and abstract. Replace with a precise, small action beat (e.g., "The floorboards creaked under new weight.") to maintain pace and clarity.

- Restore the touch-point’s core subtlety: explicitly emphasize the quiet normalcy of the cottage failing to recognize the predator only through sensory detail, not declarative statements. Add one brief line that ties the kettle’s sigh to complacency (e.g., "The kettle sighed as if nothing were odd.") rather than naming the cottage's failure to recognize danger.

- Tighten the opening sentence rhythm: the first three sentences compete for attention. Consider merging into two compact images: latch click + kettle sigh + warm air spilling — so the scene opens with a clean, immediate beat.

- Adjust "Mint-scented air held an unasked question" if you keep it: make it more active/less abstract (e.g., "Mint and ash lingered like a question no one voiced.") Or scrap it if you keep the earlier scent line.

- Rebalance dialog/action: after Wolf’s line, insert a short internal observation from him (one sentence) about timing or witnesses—very brief—to recall his calculative nature and justify the pause before he moves. Keep it in his voice but narrated.

- Preserve the writer’s quirks (lyricism, small metaphors) but favor gestures and concrete sensations over abstract nouns; apply this rule consistently in the three most metaphor-heavy sentences noted above.

- Final pass: read aloud Wolf’s lines to ensure sibilants and mild theatrical menace come through; tweak punctuation (commas, em dashes) to let his cadence breathe without becoming florid.
