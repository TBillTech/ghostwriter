You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Wolf paused among the thyme and cabbage, letting the garden hold him in its slow, sunlit breath—bees droning, warm smoke rising from Grandmother's chimney. He pressed one paw to the warm dirt and shook pine needles from his coat. Nettle and wood smoke rose from Grandmother's kettle. Wolf listened toward the lane: no footfall, no Red yet, only the slow metronome of Grandmother's clock ticking somewhere beyond the door.

Wolf measured the sun on the shingles and counted the light like small reckonings—there would be time before Red could reach the Cottage. Wolf checked the hedge and the path for witnesses: no hound, no hunter, no neighbor. He smoothed his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath. He padded to the doorstep, ears tuning to the room’s tiny sounds, and studied the thumb-worn latch; the iron glowed faint with afternoon heat, familiar as a well-used word. Behind closed teeth he rehearsed the cadence he would wear.

---

He knocked once.

"Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Grandmother (muffled): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Wolf, Grandmother

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
Latch yields with a tame click, warm air braided with mint and ash spills from the doorway, and the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust.
Wolf, whiskers twitching, purred, "Here we are, easy as a kiss on the thumb; the room accepts the invitation with a sigh of warmth. Shall I close it, Grandmother, or leave the door a breath longer for soft entry??"
Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Close the door quick, dear; a chill is creeping in and the latch must hold.."
Floorboards take a new weight, a careful step heavier than the cottage expects, and the room breathes a different rhythm as it weighs its welcome against the visitor's measured tread.
The cottage adapts to the measured tread, and the mint-scented air brims with the unspoken question of what comes next.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove or rewrite the opening sentence’s abstract phrasing. Replace "Latch yields with a tame click, warm air braided with mint and ash spills from the doorway, and the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust." with a tighter sensory beat: "The latch clicked. Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway; the moment held, equal parts invitation and caution."

- Change Wolf’s line to match his smooth, sly cadence and avoid him narrating the room’s reaction. Replace the entire quoted line with something shorter and more manipulative, e.g.: "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?" Avoid similes like "easy as a kiss on the thumb" (feels anachronistic/overwrought) and drop the double question marks and extra punctuation.

- Remove the clunky tag "whiskers twitching, purred," and instead give a brief stage beat before his speech: "Wolf paused, whiskers twitching." Then deliver the revised line. This keeps the theatricality without having the character explain his own vocal texture.

- Recast Grandmother’s line to keep her cozy practicality and to avoid over-punctuation and doubled dots. Replace with: "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold." Keep "dear" to preserve her voice.

- Delete the second nearly identical sentence pair about floorboards and rhythm. The two sentences "Floorboards take a new weight..." and "The cottage adapts..." repeat the same idea. Keep one concise image: "The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known, and the room altered its breath to meet it."

- Add a tiny domestic beat to anchor the "kettle sighs" foreshadowing from the touch-point. After the latch click but before Wolf speaks, insert: "Somewhere inside, the kettle sighed." This is subtle, ties to the touch-point, and avoids explicit explanation.

- Trim "the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust" (already covered by tighter image). Avoid abstract nouns that distance the reader.

- Soften language that telegraphs threat. Replace "a careful step heavier than the cottage expects" with "a careful step, steadier than the cottage's usual quiet." Keeps the cottage unaccustomed but not melodramatic.

- Tone down phrases like "the room breathes a different rhythm" — prefer concrete sensory changes. If you want a rhythm image, make it short: "The room's rhythm shifted."

- Keep the final sentence but compress: "Mint-scented air held an unasked question." This preserves atmosphere while avoiding repetition.

- Overall balance: shorten long descriptive clauses and alternate with the two tightened dialogue beats and the single kettle-sigh insertion. Resulting structure should be: latch click + kettle sigh + small stage beat (Wolf) + Wolf line + Grandmother line + one compact sentence about floorboards + one compact atmospheric close.

- Copy-edit items: remove extra punctuation (double question marks, double periods), ensure dialogue punctuation follows standard single terminal marks, and eliminate present-tense narration slips that describe characters narrating their own feelings.
