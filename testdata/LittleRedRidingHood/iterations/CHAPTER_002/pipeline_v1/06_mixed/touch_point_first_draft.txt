Latch yields with a tame click, warm air braided with mint and ash spills from the doorway, and the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust.
Wolf, whiskers twitching, purred, "Here we are, easy as a kiss on the thumb; the room accepts the invitation with a sigh of warmth. Shall I close it, Grandmother, or leave the door a breath longer for soft entry??"
Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Close the door quick, dear; a chill is creeping in and the latch must hold.."
Floorboards take a new weight, a careful step heavier than the cottage expects, and the room breathes a different rhythm as it weighs its welcome against the visitor's measured tread.
The cottage adapts to the measured tread, and the mint-scented air brims with the unspoken question of what comes next.
