- Delete or trim one of the near-duplicate scent lines: choose either "Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway" or "Mint-scented air held an unasked question." Keep the stronger image (recommend the first) and reduce redundancy.

- Make Wolf’s spoken line lean more toward his established cadence: change "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?" to something sleeker and more coaxing (e.g., shorten, add elongated sibilants, and fold in a subtle suggestion of control). Example direction: cut to one crisp compliment, then a leading question that narrows choices.

- Add a tiny physical beat to Wolf’s approach to ground the dialogue: show him pausing with a paw on the latch or fingers (wolf’s paw) brushing the doorframe—this will connect his vocal manipulation to an actionable intention and foreshadow the click.

- Soften/ground Grandmother’s line to fit her hearth-tone and frailty. Replace "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold." with a homelier, gentler admonition (e.g., "Mind the latch, dear—there's a little chill today; warm yourself by the fire.") Keep it short but less directive and more loving.

- Trim the purple wording "The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known" — it reads heavy and abstract. Replace with a precise, small action beat (e.g., "The floorboards creaked under new weight.") to maintain pace and clarity.

- Restore the touch-point’s core subtlety: explicitly emphasize the quiet normalcy of the cottage failing to recognize the predator only through sensory detail, not declarative statements. Add one brief line that ties the kettle’s sigh to complacency (e.g., "The kettle sighed as if nothing were odd.") rather than naming the cottage's failure to recognize danger.

- Tighten the opening sentence rhythm: the first three sentences compete for attention. Consider merging into two compact images: latch click + kettle sigh + warm air spilling — so the scene opens with a clean, immediate beat.

- Adjust "Mint-scented air held an unasked question" if you keep it: make it more active/less abstract (e.g., "Mint and ash lingered like a question no one voiced.") Or scrap it if you keep the earlier scent line.

- Rebalance dialog/action: after Wolf’s line, insert a short internal observation from him (one sentence) about timing or witnesses—very brief—to recall his calculative nature and justify the pause before he moves. Keep it in his voice but narrated.

- Preserve the writer’s quirks (lyricism, small metaphors) but favor gestures and concrete sensations over abstract nouns; apply this rule consistently in the three most metaphor-heavy sentences noted above.

- Final pass: read aloud Wolf’s lines to ensure sibilants and mild theatrical menace come through; tweak punctuation (commas, em dashes) to let his cadence breathe without becoming florid.
