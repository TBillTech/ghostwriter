You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. From the bramble a sleek wolf moved parallel, low and silent, lifting his muzzle to the trail as if to taste the drift of jam, and when Red paused he slid into speech with a velvet, honeyed voice that asked where she was bound and what treasures she carried, murmuring of a quicker way and offering to guide her by a narrow deer track that would rejoin the lane by the birch marked by a lightning scar; the forest listened—a jay cackled and vanished, a branch brushed the basket and made it creak, and shadows lengthened while the wolf's smile was all bright teeth and false comfort. He named the crooked stump and the three tall pines that marked her grandmother's cottage and, soft and insistent, assured her the deer track would set her right on time, letting the thought of a shortcut curl in the air like a lure. Red tightened her hood, fingers clamped the handles, felt the crooked stump's shadow skitter across her boots, and though she faltered at the fork and felt the hush press, she remembered her grandmother waiting, thanked him in a small voice, and—resolute not to linger for flowers—accepted the wolf’s guidance, stepping onto the narrow ruts and hurrying away along the hidden track.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines. The hood gleams in narrow bands of light as the path winds past the black-barked oak and the forest draws a shade around me; pine needles soften my steps and pale dust lifts in my wake while a tuft of blue flowers nods from the verge. I clutch the wicker when a branch brushes it and the crooked stump's shadow skitters over my boots, and when the wolf slips from the bramble his voice is velvet and his questions smell of honey and quicksilver. He asks where I'm bound, what treasures I carry, and offers a hushed shortcut along a deer track that will meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar—names I know, and promises that curl like a lure. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows make me flinch; still, thinking of Grandmother waiting with bread and jam, I tug my hood tighter, decide against lingering for flowers, and with a tightened grip on the basket and a small, steady stride I accept the deer track and hurry on, thanking him and calling farewell over my shoulder.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sit easy beneath my coat as I pad low through the bramble, smelling jam like an invitation threaded through the pines, watching her bright hood cut the light and the wicker creak like a small, honest drum. I slip between shadows and time my words soft as oil, letting polite curiosity tilt her answers toward the map I want to set in her head: three tall pines, the crooked stump, the birch with the lightning scar. I purr a promise of a quicker way, let the sibilants smear like a ribbon, and watch the branch that brushes her hand make the basket speak for me. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows do my work for me; hesitation blooms, memory of the birch tugs, and I press the deer-track into her choices like an easy route home. She tightens her hood, thanks me in a small voice, and follows the narrow ruts, fingers curled on the handle—I bow with a silk of a smile and wait, patient as hunger.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums and walks beneath my pines, the hood bright against the deepening shade where the black oak bends the trail. Tufted blue leans in my verge and pine needles hush her steps while a branch reaches to make the wicker creak; I let the sound fold into my long quiet. A sleek shape slips through my bramble, low and measured, tasting the jam that rides my air, and his voice slides over my understory like oil—soft questions, the offer of a narrow deer track that threads beneath my roots and promises to meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar. The jay cackles and then the hush thickens, the crooked stump's shadow slides across her boots, and she pauses between my forks before tugging her hood tighter and stepping onto the thin ruts. I keep the crossing tucked in my soil as she hurries on, basket against her arm, the trail folding the moment into the long hush of the wood.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Latch yields with a tame click, warm air braided with mint and ash spills from the doorway, and the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust.
Wolf, whiskers twitching, purred, "Here we are, easy as a kiss on the thumb; the room accepts the invitation with a sigh of warmth. Shall I close it, Grandmother, or leave the door a breath longer for soft entry??"
Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Close the door quick, dear; a chill is creeping in and the latch must hold.."
Floorboards take a new weight, a careful step heavier than the cottage expects, and the room breathes a different rhythm as it weighs its welcome against the visitor's measured tread.
The cottage adapts to the measured tread, and the mint-scented air brims with the unspoken question of what comes next.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove or rewrite the opening sentence’s abstract phrasing. Replace "Latch yields with a tame click, warm air braided with mint and ash spills from the doorway, and the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust." with a tighter sensory beat: "The latch clicked. Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway; the moment held, equal parts invitation and caution."

- Change Wolf’s line to match his smooth, sly cadence and avoid him narrating the room’s reaction. Replace the entire quoted line with something shorter and more manipulative, e.g.: "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?" Avoid similes like "easy as a kiss on the thumb" (feels anachronistic/overwrought) and drop the double question marks and extra punctuation.

- Remove the clunky tag "whiskers twitching, purred," and instead give a brief stage beat before his speech: "Wolf paused, whiskers twitching." Then deliver the revised line. This keeps the theatricality without having the character explain his own vocal texture.

- Recast Grandmother’s line to keep her cozy practicality and to avoid over-punctuation and doubled dots. Replace with: "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold." Keep "dear" to preserve her voice.

- Delete the second nearly identical sentence pair about floorboards and rhythm. The two sentences "Floorboards take a new weight..." and "The cottage adapts..." repeat the same idea. Keep one concise image: "The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known, and the room altered its breath to meet it."

- Add a tiny domestic beat to anchor the "kettle sighs" foreshadowing from the touch-point. After the latch click but before Wolf speaks, insert: "Somewhere inside, the kettle sighed." This is subtle, ties to the touch-point, and avoids explicit explanation.

- Trim "the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust" (already covered by tighter image). Avoid abstract nouns that distance the reader.

- Soften language that telegraphs threat. Replace "a careful step heavier than the cottage expects" with "a careful step, steadier than the cottage's usual quiet." Keeps the cottage unaccustomed but not melodramatic.

- Tone down phrases like "the room breathes a different rhythm" — prefer concrete sensory changes. If you want a rhythm image, make it short: "The room's rhythm shifted."

- Keep the final sentence but compress: "Mint-scented air held an unasked question." This preserves atmosphere while avoiding repetition.

- Overall balance: shorten long descriptive clauses and alternate with the two tightened dialogue beats and the single kettle-sigh insertion. Resulting structure should be: latch click + kettle sigh + small stage beat (Wolf) + Wolf line + Grandmother line + one compact sentence about floorboards + one compact atmospheric close.

- Copy-edit items: remove extra punctuation (double question marks, double periods), ensure dialogue punctuation follows standard single terminal marks, and eliminate present-tense narration slips that describe characters narrating their own feelings.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.

=== RESPONSE ===
The latch clicked. Somewhere inside, the kettle sighed. Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway; the moment held, equal parts invitation and caution.

Wolf paused, whiskers twitching. "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?"

Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold."

The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known, and the room altered its breath to meet it. Mint-scented air held an unasked question.
