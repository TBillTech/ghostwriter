=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
Narrator: You lift the latch with a tame little click; you let warm air roll out, stitched with mint and ash.

wolf: You purr that there we are—easy as a kiss on the thumb, and you ask if you should close it, Grandmother.

grandma: You tell them to close it quick, dear; you warn that there's a chill today.

Narrator: You watch the door settle; you hear the iron tongue drop, and the kettle lets out a soft, satisfied sigh.

Narrator: You feel the floorboards take a new weight—a careful step, heavier than the cottage expects, spread on pads rather than heels.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
Narrator: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
wolf: You notice the warm air stitched with mint and ash and let the small, tame click of the latch hang like an invitation—there is a softness to the moment that tastes of welcome and of easy entry.
grandma: You bristle at the syruped politeness in that question, hearing flattery wrapped around a prompt, and you feel the chill at the thought of a door left open.
Narrator: You take the warning into the room—the admonition settles like a hand on the latch, and the kettle answers with a soft, satisfied sigh that agrees with the precaution.
Narrator: You register the change in weight across the floorboards; the thought of a careful, padded step makes the cottage notice its own smallness against something measuring its welcome.
