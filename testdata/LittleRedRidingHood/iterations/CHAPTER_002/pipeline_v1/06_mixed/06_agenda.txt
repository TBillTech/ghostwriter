=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
Narrator: You lift the latch with a tame little click; you let warm air roll out, stitched with mint and ash.

wolf: You purr that there we are—easy as a kiss on the thumb, and you ask if you should close it, Grandmother.

grandma: You tell them to close it quick, dear; you warn that there's a chill today.

Narrator: You watch the door settle; you hear the iron tongue drop, and the kettle lets out a soft, satisfied sigh.

Narrator: You feel the floorboards take a new weight—a careful step, heavier than the cottage expects, spread on pads rather than heels.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf:
* You feel the pleasure of having the tempo of the scene in your control.
* You speak to smooth a path and test receptivity; your words are bait and measured kindness.
* You care because a yielded guard or a diverted routine is progress toward satiation and advantage.
* You want the latch closed with the illusion of propriety so you can fold suspicion inward and keep the cottage’s rhythms uninterrupted.
* You aim to shorten the journey and avoid witnesses by suggesting alternatives and nudging choices.
* You hide the predatory aim beneath solicitous tones; your concern is a mask for opportunity.
* Your immediate mood is patient amusement edged with hunger; you savor the slow click of things aligning.
* You plan to maintain charm, watch for tightness, and escalate coaxing if the other softens.

grandma:
* You speak from habitual caretaking and the low urgency of domestic worry.
* You care because small practical actions promise safety and comfort for both you and your guest.
* You want the latch secured and the draft kept out; these are gestures of protection and order.
* You aim to close the gap between appearance and security with a plain, earnest reminder.
* You conceal no malice; any omissions are from frailty and trust, not manipulation.
* Your current mood is mildly anxious but steady, shaped by affection and a desire to set things right.
* You intend your words to anchor the scene in homely routine and to prompt a quick, unobtrusive compliance.
