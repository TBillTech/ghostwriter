- Remove or rewrite the opening sentence’s abstract phrasing. Replace "Latch yields with a tame click, warm air braided with mint and ash spills from the doorway, and the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust." with a tighter sensory beat: "The latch clicked. Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway; the moment held, equal parts invitation and caution."

- Change Wolf’s line to match his smooth, sly cadence and avoid him narrating the room’s reaction. Replace the entire quoted line with something shorter and more manipulative, e.g.: "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?" Avoid similes like "easy as a kiss on the thumb" (feels anachronistic/overwrought) and drop the double question marks and extra punctuation.

- Remove the clunky tag "whiskers twitching, purred," and instead give a brief stage beat before his speech: "Wolf paused, whiskers twitching." Then deliver the revised line. This keeps the theatricality without having the character explain his own vocal texture.

- Recast Grandmother’s line to keep her cozy practicality and to avoid over-punctuation and doubled dots. Replace with: "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold." Keep "dear" to preserve her voice.

- Delete the second nearly identical sentence pair about floorboards and rhythm. The two sentences "Floorboards take a new weight..." and "The cottage adapts..." repeat the same idea. Keep one concise image: "The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known, and the room altered its breath to meet it."

- Add a tiny domestic beat to anchor the "kettle sighs" foreshadowing from the touch-point. After the latch click but before Wolf speaks, insert: "Somewhere inside, the kettle sighed." This is subtle, ties to the touch-point, and avoids explicit explanation.

- Trim "the moment sits with a patient invitation balancing caution and trust" (already covered by tighter image). Avoid abstract nouns that distance the reader.

- Soften language that telegraphs threat. Replace "a careful step heavier than the cottage expects" with "a careful step, steadier than the cottage's usual quiet." Keeps the cottage unaccustomed but not melodramatic.

- Tone down phrases like "the room breathes a different rhythm" — prefer concrete sensory changes. If you want a rhythm image, make it short: "The room's rhythm shifted."

- Keep the final sentence but compress: "Mint-scented air held an unasked question." This preserves atmosphere while avoiding repetition.

- Overall balance: shorten long descriptive clauses and alternate with the two tightened dialogue beats and the single kettle-sigh insertion. Resulting structure should be: latch click + kettle sigh + small stage beat (Wolf) + Wolf line + Grandmother line + one compact sentence about floorboards + one compact atmospheric close.

- Copy-edit items: remove extra punctuation (double question marks, double periods), ensure dialogue punctuation follows standard single terminal marks, and eliminate present-tense narration slips that describe characters narrating their own feelings.
