Dust trembled in a narrow bar of light that slipped past the hooked shutters, and the mantel clock ticked hard enough to mark each second against the boards. The teapot breathed in soft pulses; its lid quivered, kissing the rim. From far off, axe strokes thudded in measured rhythm, sap-scent riding with a faint tang of iron. A chair lay overturned near the bedside, legs splayed like a small confession.

Wolf lay propped beneath the strawberry quilt, the bed curtains drawn to a half-theater hush. Grandmother’s nightcap sat soft over Wolf’s ears and spectacles smudged the glass; Wolf patted a dab from the powder tin across the muzzle to soften the snout’s line. The feather quilt puffed smooth as Wolf tucked its edge to blunt the outline beneath, and Wolf’s tail hid quiet under the bedskirt, the fringe lifting a breath and settling.
