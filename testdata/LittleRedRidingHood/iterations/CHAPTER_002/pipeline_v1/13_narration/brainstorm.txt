* Dust trembles within a narrow bar of light that slips past the hooked shutters.
* The mantel clock ticks hard enough to mark each second against the boards.
* The teapot breathes in soft pulses; its lid quivers, kissing the rim.
* From far off, axe strokes thud in measured rhythm, sap-scent riding with a faint tang of iron.
* wolf lies propped beneath the strawberry quilt, bed curtains drawn to a half-theater hush.
* The feather quilt puffs smooth as he tucks its edge to blunt the outline beneath.
* wolfâ€™s tail hides quiet under the bedskirt; the fringe lifts a breath and settles.
