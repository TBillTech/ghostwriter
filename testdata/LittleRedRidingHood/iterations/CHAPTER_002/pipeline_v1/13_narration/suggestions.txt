- Replace the repeated phrasing "The teapot breathed in soft pulses; the teapot’s lid quivered" with a single, tighter image (e.g., "The teapot breathed in soft pulses; its lid quivered against the rim") to remove redundancy and sharpen rhythm.

- Swap "sap and iron in the air" to "iron and sap in the air" so the olfactory image matches the touch-point's intended coupling and cadence.

- Start the second paragraph with "Wolf" instead of "He" at least once (e.g., "Wolf lay propped beneath the strawberry quilt...") to avoid any momentary pronoun ambiguity and keep narration anchored to the character.

- Change "He patted a dab from the powder tin across the muzzle to soften the snout’s line" to a clearer, more idiomatic action (e.g., "Wolf dabbed powder along the muzzle to soften the snout's line") to tighten voice and remove the awkward "patted a dab."

- Tighten "the bed curtains drawn to a half-theater hush" to something slightly more immediate and consistent with prior touch-points (e.g., "the bed curtains drawn to a private, dimmed hush" or "a half-dimmed hush") to preserve the author's unusual phrasing while avoiding an image that jars.

- Make the clock tactilely present earlier in the paragraph: move or emphasize "the mantel clock’s tick grew loud enough to measure nerves" so it cues the tail-twitch and the room's tempo more directly (for example, place that sentence immediately before "the fringe lifted once with the clock’s tick, then settled").

- Replace "his tail hid quiet under the bedskirt; the fringe lifted once with the clock’s tick, then settled" with a slightly more precise gesture (e.g., "Wolf's tail tucked beneath the bedskirt; its fringe lifted once at the clock's tick, then fell") so the subject remains explicit and the physical reaction reads cleanly.

- Consider swapping "tucked its edge to blur the outline beneath" for a tighter verb (e.g., "tucked the edge to blur his outline") to reduce passivity and keep the sentence rhythm lean.

- Remove any phrasing that could verge on the forbidden foreshadowing items (avoid mentioning humming, the path tune, or ears lifting) — these are not present now, but double-check future sentences to keep that omission consistent.
