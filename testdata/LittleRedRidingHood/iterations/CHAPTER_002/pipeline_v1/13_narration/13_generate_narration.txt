- Story so far:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. From the bramble a sleek wolf moved parallel, low and silent, lifting his muzzle to the trail as if to taste the drift of jam, and when Red paused he slid into speech with a velvet, honeyed voice that asked where she was bound and what treasures she carried, murmuring of a quicker way and offering to guide her by a narrow deer track that would rejoin the lane by the birch marked by a lightning scar; the forest listened—a jay cackled and vanished, a branch brushed the basket and made it creak, and shadows lengthened while the wolf's smile was all bright teeth and false comfort. He named the crooked stump and the three tall pines that marked her grandmother's cottage and, soft and insistent, assured her the deer track would set her right on time, letting the thought of a shortcut curl in the air like a lure. Red tightened her hood, fingers clamped the handles, felt the crooked stump's shadow skitter across her boots, and though she faltered at the fork and felt the hush press, she remembered her grandmother waiting, thanked him in a small voice, and—resolute not to linger for flowers—accepted the wolf’s guidance, stepping onto the narrow ruts and hurrying away along the hidden track.

- Story relative to:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines. The hood gleams in narrow bands of light as the path winds past the black-barked oak and the forest draws a shade around me; pine needles soften my steps and pale dust lifts in my wake while a tuft of blue flowers nods from the verge. I clutch the wicker when a branch brushes it and the crooked stump's shadow skitters over my boots, and when the wolf slips from the bramble his voice is velvet and his questions smell of honey and quicksilver. He asks where I'm bound, what treasures I carry, and offers a hushed shortcut along a deer track that will meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar—names I know, and promises that curl like a lure. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows make me flinch; still, thinking of Grandmother waiting with bread and jam, I tug my hood tighter, decide against lingering for flowers, and with a tightened grip on the basket and a small, steady stride I accept the deer track and hurry on, thanking him and calling farewell over my shoulder.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sit easy beneath my coat as I pad low through the bramble, smelling jam like an invitation threaded through the pines, watching her bright hood cut the light and the wicker creak like a small, honest drum. I slip between shadows and time my words soft as oil, letting polite curiosity tilt her answers toward the map I want to set in her head: three tall pines, the crooked stump, the birch with the lightning scar. I purr a promise of a quicker way, let the sibilants smear like a ribbon, and watch the branch that brushes her hand make the basket speak for me. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows do my work for me; hesitation blooms, memory of the birch tugs, and I press the deer-track into her choices like an easy route home. She tightens her hood, thanks me in a small voice, and follows the narrow ruts, fingers curled on the handle—I bow with a silk of a smile and wait, patient as hunger.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums and walks beneath my pines, the hood bright against the deepening shade where the black oak bends the trail. Tufted blue leans in my verge and pine needles hush her steps while a branch reaches to make the wicker creak; I let the sound fold into my long quiet. A sleek shape slips through my bramble, low and measured, tasting the jam that rides my air, and his voice slides over my understory like oil—soft questions, the offer of a narrow deer track that threads beneath my roots and promises to meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar. The jay cackles and then the hush thickens, the crooked stump's shadow slides across her boots, and she pauses between my forks before tugging her hood tighter and stepping onto the thin ruts. I keep the crossing tucked in my soil as she hurries on, basket against her arm, the trail folding the moment into the long hush of the wood.

Touch-Point
===========
Text: Dust shivers in a bar of light that escaped the shutters; the clock’s tick grows loud enough to measure nerves.
From far off, a rhythm of axe on wood answers the kettle’s breath, iron and sap interlacing on the air.

- Actors: Wolf
- Foreshadowing: A faint thread of humming drifts through the garden—the tune Red kept on the path—then fades as the wind shifts.
The Wolf’s ears lift under the nightcap. He smiles with care, and waits.
- Prior paragraph (if any): Pewter light thins as the shutter hook tames the day, and the room settles into a quiet hush. A faint thread of a tune slips past the shutter and dies on the sill. Shadows gather along the bed curtains; the boards creak softly, a patient witness.

Wolf purred, spectacles crooked, "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
He tips a slippered paw toward the doorway. He coughs—a practised, small sound.

"Oh, what a day you must have had," he said, voice higher, kinder.
His fingers drift to the shawl, smoothing the fold. He straightens his spectacles with the back of a claw.

"Sit. Rest. Grandmother will be so grateful."
He settles deeper into the quilt. His tail twitches once beneath the bedskirt, and the corner of his mouth tightens around the edge of a smile.

=== RESPONSE ===
Dust trembled in a narrow bar of light that slipped past the hooked shutters, and the mantel clock ticked hard enough to mark each second against the boards. The teapot breathed in soft pulses; its lid quivered, kissing the rim. From far off, axe strokes thudded in measured rhythm, sap-scent riding with a faint tang of iron. A chair lay overturned near the bedside, legs splayed like a small confession.

Wolf lay propped beneath the strawberry quilt, the bed curtains drawn to a half-theater hush. Grandmother’s nightcap sat soft over Wolf’s ears and spectacles smudged the glass; Wolf patted a dab from the powder tin across the muzzle to soften the snout’s line. The feather quilt puffed smooth as Wolf tucked its edge to blunt the outline beneath, and Wolf’s tail hid quiet under the bedskirt, the fringe lifting a breath and settling.
