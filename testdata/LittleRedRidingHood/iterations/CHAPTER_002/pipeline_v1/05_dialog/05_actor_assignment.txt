=== SYSTEM ===
Assign dialog lines to actors as 'id: line' entries.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."


# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* wolf softens his breath to a child’s whisper by the thyme gate
* wolf: Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?
* The kettle sighs behind the door while the clock keeps its tiny march
* grandma from within, voice quilt-soft and thin with distance
* grandma: Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting.
* wolf lets a low chuckle die in his throat before it is a sound
* wolf: The basket is a bit heavy today, but I hurried on the nice path
* The thumb-worn iron warms under afternoon light and patient fingers
* grandma: Mind the latch, dear. It sticks if you don’t lift it true
* wolf: I remember, Grandmother. Up, then in, quiet as a mouse

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You soften your breath to a child's whisper by the thyme gate, as if the sound itself might slip through cracks and be believed.

wolf: You murmur, "Grandmother, it's me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Narrator: You hear the kettle sigh behind the door while the clock keeps its tiny march.

grandma: You answer from within, your voice quilt-soft and thin with distance.

grandma: You call, "Lift the latch, child. I've been waiting."

wolf: You let a low chuckle die in your throat before it becomes a sound anyone could pin down.

wolf: You tell her, "The basket is a bit heavy today, but I hurried on the nice path."

Narrator: You notice the thumb-worn iron warming under afternoon light and patient fingers.

grandma: You admonish gently, "Mind the latch, dear. It sticks if you don't lift it true."

wolf: You reassure, "I remember, Grandmother. Up, then in, quiet as a mouse."
