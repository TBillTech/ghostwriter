=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm dialog beats as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door. The Wolf counts the clock's beats against his own breaths as he moves from shadow to sill, placing careful paws on the creaking step. He notes the walking stick by the jamb and the sun-bleached, thumb-worn latch, measures the latch's height, and readies himself for the sound that will open this particular threshold.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'At the Cottage Gate', 'description': 'Having slipped from the deer track ahead of Red, the Wolf reaches a small cottage tucked in thyme and smoke.\nThe garden is a patchwork of herbs and cabbages, the door sun-bleached and simple; inside, a kettle hums and an old clock ticks.\nThe world here smells of mint and ash and rest, vulnerable in its quiet routine.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Cottage Door-Latch', 'significance': 'Threshold of trust; a simple defense turned invitation', 'description': 'A thumb-worn iron latch, warm from afternoon light.\nIt answers to a familiar knock and an even more familiar voice.\n'}, {'name': 'Hearth and Kettle', 'significance': 'Homeliness to be imitated; cover for small sounds', 'description': 'A blackened iron kettle keeps time in soft breaths over banked coals,\nits steam sewing the room together with the smell of nettle tea.\n'}, {'name': 'Teacup on Saucer', 'significance': 'Grandmother’s pause interrupted', 'description': 'Porcelain with a hairline crack, rim blushed by tea.\nIt waits beside a chair draped with a shawl.\n'}, {'name': 'Walking Stick', 'significance': 'Measure of frailty the Wolf will exploit', 'description': 'A hazel stick, polished by years of palms, leaning by the door.\n'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
The, Wolf, Grandmother

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."



# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative lines to give the readers clarity and flavor, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.

* wolf: I remember, Grandmother. Up, then in, quiet as a mouse
* The walking stick by the jamb casts a slender, wavering shadow

* wolf: I’ll be gentle as a whisper, Grandmother. Mama sends her love
* The garden’s cabbages hold their breath as the hinge thinks of singing
* grandma: Tell your mother I’m grateful. Now lift and come along, sweetheart
* wolf: Only a moment more, Grandmother. I don’t want the latch to complain
* The room beyond feels stitched together by nettle steam and old floorboards
* grandma: You know the way of it. Up with the thumb, then down easy
* wolf repeats her words back, softened to please the ear
* wolf: Up with the thumb, then down easy. I won’t keep you waiting
