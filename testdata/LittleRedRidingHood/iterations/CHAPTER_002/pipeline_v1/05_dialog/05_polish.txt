These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf breathed low, "Shh, little one; the thyme at the gate sighs safety, and I only murmur a gentler, quicker way to your door.  
Let me show you a path that keeps your feet light and your worries quiet.  
Tell me which way your heart points, and I’ll guide you there with a soft word and a careful smile.."
The Wolf murmured, "Ah, sweet voice, child; your words carry the warmth of bread and jam. I know a gentler, quicker way to Grandmother’s door, if your feet will trust a patient guide. Which path did you choose, and I’ll lead you there with a whisper and a careful smile.?"
The kettle sighs behind the door, steam tracing a pale smile in the air as the clock keeps its tiny march. The cottage gathers its quiet questions, waiting for a soft word to tilt the threshold toward trust without alarm.
Grandmother answered, "Come in, dear; the door’s quiet now and the stove is warm. You’re safe here by the glow, so sit a moment and I’ll pour tea—sweeten it if you like. Tell me what brings you to my door tonight; we’ll set it to rights together, sweetheart.."
Grandmother called, "Lift the latch, dear; I’ve been waiting to welcome you in from the wind. Come, sit by the stove; the kettle hums softly, and we’ll set things to rights with a warm cup of tea.."
The Wolf swallowed, "Your caution is a bright coin, child, and I’ll spend it wisely on the shortest route to Grandmother’s door. 
If your heart trusts a patient guide, we’ll take the quicker path—quiet as a shadow, swift as a sigh. 
Draw near and listen; my whisper will be your lantern until we lift the latch together.."
The Wolf reassured, "That basket feels heavier today, little one, but I know the nice path that keeps your steps light. There's a quicker route—gentler on your feet—that will bring us straight to Grandmother's door. Tell me which way your heart points, and I’ll guide you there with a soft word and a careful smile.."
The latch, warm as afternoon light, rests under patient fingers, turning the door into a familiar harbor rather than a threshold. Beneath the ordinary gentleness, a watchful calm thinly veils the teeth of risk as the wolf’s approach learns to sound like a soft invitation.
Grandmother admonished, "Be mindful of the latch, dear—lift it firmly so it sits true. You're inside now; come sit by the stove and we'll set things to rights with a warm cup of tea.."
The Wolf promised, "Yes, I remember the route—the climb to the door and a whisper-soft entrance. Your caution is a bright coin, dear child; I’ll spend it wisely to keep us swift. Trust my quiet guidance; we’ll reach Grandmother’s door without a stir.."

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.
