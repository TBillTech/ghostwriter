=== SYSTEM ===
You write third-person narrative prose without quotation marks.

=== USER ===
You are writing third-person narrative prose that bridges or frames the surrounding dialog.

Rules:
- Do not use quotation marks.
- Keep the voice consistent with the current chapter’s style and scene.
- Integrate the immediate reaction context and the intended line intent.
- Be concise but evocative. Just a sentence or two. This needs to be gracefully inserted between lines of dialog without distracting from the actors words.
- Avoid actor attributions; this is narration, not a spoken line.

Context (may be partial and pre-formatted):

    "Shh, little one; the thyme at the gate sighs safety, and I only murmur a gentler, quicker way to your door.  \nLet me show you a path that keeps your feet light and your worries quiet.  \nTell me which way your heart points, and I’ll guide you there with a soft word and a careful smile.",
    "Ah, sweet voice, child; your words carry the warmth of bread and jam. I know a gentler, quicker way to Grandmother’s door, if your feet will trust a patient guide. Which path did you choose, and I’ll lead you there with a whisper and a careful smile.",
    "Your caution is a bright coin, child, and I’ll spend it wisely on the shortest route to Grandmother’s door. \nIf your heart trusts a patient guide, we’ll take the quicker path—quiet as a shadow, swift as a sigh. \nDraw near and listen; my whisper will be your lantern until we lift the latch together.",
    "That basket feels heavier today, little one, but I know the nice path that keeps your steps light. There's a quicker route—gentler on your feet—that will bring us straight to Grandmother's door. Tell me which way your heart points, and I’ll guide you there with a soft word and a careful smile."

Immediate cues:
- Line intent: You notice the thumb-worn iron warming under afternoon light and patient fingers.
- Reaction to previous line: You watch the small domestic detail—the warmed iron, the patient fingers—and see how it undercuts menace with homely proof, offering the impostor a veneer of normalcy.

=== RESPONSE ===
The latch, warm as afternoon light, rests under patient fingers, turning the door into a familiar harbor rather than a threshold. Beneath the ordinary gentleness, a watchful calm thinly veils the teeth of risk as the wolf’s approach learns to sound like a soft invitation.
