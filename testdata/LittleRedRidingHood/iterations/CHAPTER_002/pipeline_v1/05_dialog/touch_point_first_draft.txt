The wolf breathed low. "Shh, little one; the thyme at the gate sighs safety, and I only murmur a gentler, quicker way to your door. Let me show you a path that keeps your feet light and your worries quiet. Tell me which way your heart points, and I’ll guide you there with a soft word and a careful smile."

"Ah, sweet voice, child," the wolf murmured, "your words carry the warmth of bread and jam. I know a gentler, quicker way to Grandmother’s door, if your feet will trust a patient guide. Which path did you choose, and I’ll lead you there with a whisper and a careful smile?"

Behind the door the kettle sighed, steam tracing a pale smile in the air as the clock kept its tiny march. The cottage gathered its quiet questions, waiting for a soft word to tilt the threshold toward trust without alarm.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answered. "The door’s quiet now and the stove is warm. You’re safe here by the glow, so sit a moment and I’ll pour tea—sweeten it if you like. Tell me what brings you to my door tonight; we’ll set it to rights together, sweetheart."

"Lift the latch, dear," she called. "I’ve been waiting to welcome you in from the wind. Come, sit by the stove; the kettle hums softly, and we’ll set things to rights with a warm cup of tea."

The wolf swallowed. "Your caution is a bright coin, child, and I’ll spend it wisely on the shortest route to Grandmother’s door. If your heart trusts a patient guide, we’ll take the quicker path—quiet as a shadow, swift as a sigh. Draw near and listen; my whisper will be your lantern until we lift the latch together."

"That basket feels heavier today, little one," the wolf reassured. "But I know the nice path that keeps your steps light. There's a quicker route—gentler on your feet—that will bring us straight to Grandmother's door. Tell me which way your heart points, and I’ll guide you there with a soft word and a careful smile."

The latch, warm as afternoon light, rested under patient fingers, turning the door into a familiar harbor rather than a threshold. Beneath the ordinary gentleness, a watchful calm thinly veiled the teeth of risk as the wolf’s approach learned to sound like a soft invitation.

"Be mindful of the latch, dear—lift it firmly so it sits true," Grandmother admonished. "You're inside now; come sit by the stove and we'll set things to rights with a warm cup of tea."

"Yes, I remember the route—the climb to the door and a whisper-soft entrance," the wolf promised. "Your caution is a bright coin, dear child; I’ll spend it wisely to keep us swift. Trust my quiet guidance; we’ll reach Grandmother’s door without a stir."
