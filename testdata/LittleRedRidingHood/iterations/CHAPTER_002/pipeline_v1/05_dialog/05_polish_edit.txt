# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
A kettle hummed inside the cottage.

Wolf (soft, breathy, mimicking Red): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."

(The latch lifts.)

Grandmother (warm, a little raspy): "Come in, dear. Sit by the stove."

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.

=== RESPONSE ===
A kettle hummed inside the cottage. Wolf leaned close to the door and, soft and breathy, mimicked Red. "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?" From within, muffled with age, Grandmother answered, "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting." The latch lifted. Grandmother, warm and a little raspy, said, "Come in, dear. Sit by the stove."
