=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You soften your breath to a child's whisper by the thyme gate, as if the sound itself might slip through cracks and be believed.

wolf: You murmur, "Grandmother, it's me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Narrator: You hear the kettle sigh behind the door while the clock keeps its tiny march.

grandma: You answer from within, your voice quilt-soft and thin with distance.

grandma: You call, "Lift the latch, child. I've been waiting."

wolf: You let a low chuckle die in your throat before it becomes a sound anyone could pin down.

wolf: You tell her, "The basket is a bit heavy today, but I hurried on the nice path."

Narrator: You notice the thumb-worn iron warming under afternoon light and patient fingers.

grandma: You admonish gently, "Mind the latch, dear. It sticks if you don't lift it true."

wolf: You reassure, "I remember, Grandmother. Up, then in, quiet as a mouse."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
wolf: You test whether the softened breath you just practiced will read as a child's tremble, pleased to hear it feather the syllables but measuring how believable the smallness sounds.
Narrator: You listen for the domestic noises that will answer that voice, noting how the kettle's sigh and the clock's march might give weight to the scene and betray no alarm.
grandma: You register the murmur at the door as if through a wool blanket, letting warmth and wariness braid together before you form an answer.
grandma: You feel the urge to welcome—an old habit of hospitality—tempered by the thinness in that voice, and you fold that caution into your call to lift the latch.
wolf: You let the low chuckle you almost made die away and measure how her caution landed, savoring the frisson of permission braided with distance.
wolf: You smooth your reassurance like butter over bread, aware of the tiny lie in the basket's weight and how the mention of the "nice path" keeps the mood gentle and unquestioning.
Narrator: You watch the small domestic detail—the warmed iron, the patient fingers—and see how it undercuts menace with homely proof, offering the impostor a veneer of normalcy.
grandma: You tuck a mild reproach into your words about the latch, steadying the room with practical care while keeping your tone meant to soothe rather than startle.
wolf: You acknowledge the admonition and let your answer sound obedient and meek, tasting how "quiet as a mouse" slides acceptance into her worry.
