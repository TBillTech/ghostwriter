Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

Agenda notes (focus for this scene):
* You aim to sound harmless and familiar to lower the other's guard.
* You are using practiced warmth and slight artifice to imitate a child’s voice.
* You care because gaining entry advances a deeper appetite and a plan; the words are a means, not an end.
* You want the latch opened and the door unbarred without suspicion.
* You also want reassurance that no one else is watching or will intervene.
* You deliberately soften pauses and small complaints to appear genuine and self-effacing.
* You hide the predatory intent behind concern and flattery; you will not admit this motive.
* You are patient and measuring: each phrase is a test of trust and timing.
* Your mood is coolly amused and focused; there is an undercurrent of hunger that you steady with charm.
* You prefer to steer the interaction toward solitude and compliance.
* You fear being unmasked by blunt skepticism or unexpected witnesses, so you escalate only as trust is given.

* You want the latch lifted quickly so the visit can proceed to its comforting rhythm.
* You also want the other to be safe and to feel welcomed; your words aim to soothe and direct.
* You conceal worry beneath practical instruction; you will not dwell on fears but will hint at them through caution.
* Your mood is warm and steady, threaded with fragility that you buffer with firmness.
* You prefer clear, simple directions that restore order and ease anxious moments.
* You avoid alarmist language; instead you use small authority to speed the other’s cooperation.
* You hope the exchange remains ordinary and untroubling, preserving the comfort you cherish.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: I knock with small-knuckle politeness, letting the sun-bleached wood remember its manners. I mean no harm, only a quiet moment of talk before the day tacks on another mile. Is there a listener inside, or shall I wait a heartbeat longer?
wolf: I smooth the sound of my throat until it glows with a small, bright note. It's me—the one Mama sent bread and jam for. May I come in?
grandma: Come in, dear. Mind the latch and wipe your feet; I’ve been waiting by the stove.
wolf: I pause at the threshold, then murmur a small, bright note of thanks. May I step inside for a moment, to keep the warmth from fading?
wolf: The basket is heavy, and the latch sticks. Could you coax it for a moment and let me in?
grandma: Come in, dear; give that hinge a firm thumb and mind your fingers.
