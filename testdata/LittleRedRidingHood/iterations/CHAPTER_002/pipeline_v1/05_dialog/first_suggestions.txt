1. Remove the stray actor name "The" if present as a speaker.

2. Delete redundant wolf passages that repeat the same promise of a "gentler, quicker way" (lines: first paragraph, second paragraph, the pair beginning "The wolf swallowed..." and the later "Yes, I remember the route..." and "That basket feels heavier today..."). Consolidate into one sharp mimicking speech.

3. Replace the consolidated wolf text with a single line that exactly performs the required touch-point mimic: Wolf (soft, breathy, mimicking Red): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?" — keep it short, breathy, and childlike.

4. Remove or drastically shorten the long narrative/descriptive paragraphs (e.g., "Behind the door the kettle sighed..." and "The latch, warm as afternoon light..."). Either convert them to brief stage directions or omit them. If retained, make them one short sentence of scene-setting, not lyrical prose.

5. Replace Grandmother’s long, chatty invitations with the required muffled response and one short, warm follow-up if needed:
   - Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."
   - Optional single short line after latch is lifted: Grandmother (warm, a little raspy): "Come in, dear. Sit by the stove."

6. Remove lines where characters narrate their own physical actions or internal states (e.g., "The wolf breathed low.", "The wolf swallowed.", "I remember the route..."). If a physical cue is needed, put it in a brief parenthetical stage direction, not in dialogue.

7. Delete overwrought similes and metaphors inside dialogue that feel stagey or literalized ("thyme at the gate sighs safety", "your caution is a bright coin", "quiet as a shadow, swift as a sigh"). Replace with simple, believable lines a wolf would use while mimicking a child ("Mama sent bread and jam," "May I come in?") or a single sly aside for the Wolf outside dialogue if necessary.

8. Remove duplicated instructions about the latch being lifted from Grandmother ("Be mindful of the latch..." and earlier similar lines). Keep only the required "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting." plus the optional short "Come in, dear."

9. Ensure speaker labels are consistent and limited to allowed actors ("Wolf" and "Grandmother"). Do not attribute internal narration to them.

10. After edits, run the scene to confirm:
   - The Wolf delivers the mimic line exactly once.
   - Grandmother's muffled "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting." appears intact and is the primary response.
   - Only brief, necessary stage-setting remains; all repetition and lyrical excess are removed.
