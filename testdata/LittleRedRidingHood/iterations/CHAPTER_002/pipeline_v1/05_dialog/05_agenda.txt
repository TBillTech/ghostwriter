=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You soften your breath to a child's whisper by the thyme gate, as if the sound itself might slip through cracks and be believed.

wolf: You murmur, "Grandmother, it's me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"

Narrator: You hear the kettle sigh behind the door while the clock keeps its tiny march.

grandma: You answer from within, your voice quilt-soft and thin with distance.

grandma: You call, "Lift the latch, child. I've been waiting."

wolf: You let a low chuckle die in your throat before it becomes a sound anyone could pin down.

wolf: You tell her, "The basket is a bit heavy today, but I hurried on the nice path."

Narrator: You notice the thumb-worn iron warming under afternoon light and patient fingers.

grandma: You admonish gently, "Mind the latch, dear. It sticks if you don't lift it true."

wolf: You reassure, "I remember, Grandmother. Up, then in, quiet as a mouse."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf:
* You intend to be plausible and gentle; your words are crafted to be taken for granted.
* You need the child’s compliance to open the door; every syllable is a tiny lever toward that end.
* You want access to the cottage and its solitude more than you want praise; the door is the object of action.
* You hide a predatory aim beneath warmth; your friendliness masks a strategic hunger.
* You prefer to shorten the interaction and avoid witnesses; haste framed as helpfulness serves you.
* You aim to lower suspicion by echoing familiar phrases and offering small conveniences.
* You are amused at your own success when a plan proceeds; a private satisfaction underpins your performance.
* You speak with patient cunning—measured, coaxing, and ready to bend if unexpected resistance appears.
* You fear being exposed by an alarm or intrusion; you keep contingency in reserve.

grandma:
* You speak from habit and care; your instructions are meant to keep the house and visitor safe.
* You want the latch lifted correctly because small errors cause problems; practical caution guides you.
* You value the company and the comfort the visitor brings; the arrival is a small solace to you.
* You hide any larger worry about vulnerability behind gentle admonition; tenderness softens your command.
* You expect obedience and the natural order of visits; the request is as much reassurance as instruction.
* You are mildly anxious but composed; steady affection steadies the edge of your concern.
* You favor routine and clarity; a clear step-by-step keeps fear manageable.
* You hope the exchange will remain ordinary and unremarkable; normalcy is itself a protection.
