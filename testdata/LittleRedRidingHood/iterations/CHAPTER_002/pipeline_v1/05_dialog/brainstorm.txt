* wolf softens his breath to a child’s whisper by the thyme gate
* wolf: Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?
* The kettle sighs behind the door while the clock keeps its tiny march
* grandma from within, voice quilt-soft and thin with distance
* grandma: Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting.
* wolf lets a low chuckle die in his throat before it is a sound
* wolf: The basket is a bit heavy today, but I hurried on the nice path
* The thumb-worn iron warms under afternoon light and patient fingers
* grandma: Mind the latch, dear. It sticks if you don’t lift it true
* wolf: I remember, Grandmother. Up, then in, quiet as a mouse
