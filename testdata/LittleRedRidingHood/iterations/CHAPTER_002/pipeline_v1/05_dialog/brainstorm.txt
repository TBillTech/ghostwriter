* wolf stands at the sun-bleached door and wolf softly taps the wood as if with small knuckles.
* wolf smooths his voice until it is small and bright as a child’s: Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?
* grandma, muffled and warm: Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting.
* wolf lets a careful pause bloom, as if shy feet shift on the step.
* wolf, still the child: The basket is heavy. The latch sticks sometimes.
* grandma, fond and practical: Thumb it hard, dear. Mind the hinge.
