- Tighten first sentence rhythm: merge or trim two clauses ("The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room.")—make it crisper to heighten momentum into the Wolf's entrance.

- Vary sentence lengths in the second paragraph: break "The Wolf stepped forward..." sentence into two shorter beats before the swallow to increase tension (e.g., one sentence for the Wolf's approach, one for Grandmother's breath, then the swallow).

- Make the swallowing beat more sensory and immediate: add one concrete sound or tactile image (a single crisp verb like "snapped" or "closed") to sharpen the moment.

- Clarify the wolf-as-disguise action: change "arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened" to something more active and characterful that preserves his theatricality (e.g., "perched the nightcap, nudged the spectacles, folded his ears until his silhouette softened into something grandmotherly").

- Emphasize that the Wolf is unfazed by his distended belly (to match the touch-point) with one small, characterful next clause or sentence rather than stating it plainly—use his cadence/voice or a small action (a satisfied tilt of the head, a low chuckle, a teasing aside).

- Replace or clarify "smoothed powder across his muzzle": make the action feel wolfish and manipulative (e.g., "puffed a theatrical dusting of powder across his muzzle") so it reads as performance, not a domestic habit.

- Consider adding a single, short line of Wolf dialogue in his established cadence immediately after he arranges the disguise—keeps voice alive and signals intent while staying within allowed speakers (e.g., sly, teasing suggestion or faux concern).

- Trim or tighten passive domestic imagery that slows the scene (e.g., "The teapot sighed, and a hush filled the room.")—either make it sharper or cut it to maintain forward motion.

- Watch pronoun proximity: ensure "he" and "his" clearly refer to the Wolf in the line where he tests balance and smooths powder (if confusion possible, replace with "the Wolf" once).

- Optional: if you want more menace without being explicit, add a tiny sensory detail of the belly (a slow, satisfied ripple or soft thud against floorboards) rather than more explanation—keeps the image vivid and concise.
