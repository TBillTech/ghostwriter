- Replace sentence-starting pronouns with "Wolf" where possible so subject is always explicit (e.g., "He paused..." → "Wolf paused...", "He pinched..." → "Wolf pinched...").
- Make the moment of sensing explicit: change "scenting the warmth, counting heartbeats" to something concrete tied to Wolf (e.g., "scenting the hearth smoke and counting the cottage's slow heartbeats") to remove ambiguity about what is counting.
- Clarify causality around the chair/teacup: state that Grandmother rose and was knocked by the chair tipping, then fell, so the sequence (rise → chair tips → teacup askew → swallow) is unambiguous.
- Tighten the swallowing line for immediacy and flow (keep the act but consider a short, hard sentence followed by the room's reaction).
- Change "A single gulp took Grandmother whole" if you want less blunt phrasing—either keep as-is for impact or soften with a clearer visual cue (e.g., "Wolf opened wide; a single gulp took Grandmother whole.") — pick one approach and apply consistently.
- Replace "pinched the powder tin of face dust" with a simpler phrase (e.g., "Wolf dabbed powder on his muzzle") to avoid awkward phrasing and improve readability.
- Replace "He didn't mind the weight in his belly." with "Wolf didn't mind the weight in his belly." to keep the actor explicit.
- Move the Basket of Goodies mention earlier or tie it more clearly to the prior touch-point (e.g., note it sat by the door when Wolf entered) so the basket isn't tacked on after the quilt action.
- Make sensory details concrete rather than vague metaphors: change "The teapot kept its whisper" and "the room answered with a thud..." to clearer sounds (e.g., "The teapot hissed softly; a chair leg struck the floor with a dull thud") to anchor the scene.
- Ensure costume actions read clearly as disguise preparation: combine short, exact actions into one sentence (powder, nightcap, ribbon, spectacles) and show how they alter Wolf's appearance to avoid choppy listing.
- Check for any pronoun "they" or ambiguous referents elsewhere and replace with proper names ("Wolf" or "Grandmother") if present.
