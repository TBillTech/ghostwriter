# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The door eased inward and Wolf slipped through the gap like a shadow finding its shape. Wolf paused on the threshold, scenting the warmth, counting heartbeats. Grandmother rose from her chair, one hand on the hazel stick, the other reaching toward the stove. Wolf crossed the hearthstones in two silent bounds, breath warm and intent. The floorboards creaked once; the chair tipped and skated, knocking the teacup askew.

A single gulp took Grandmother whole. The room answered with a thud of chair leg and a soft, settling sigh. The teapot kept its whisper; the spoon in the cup rattled and went still. Wolf’s belly rounded, heavy beneath his ribs, and he adjusted his stance until the weight found its place. Wolf didn't mind the weight in his belly. Wolf smoothed the feather quilt, tucked the Basket of Goodies beside him, and drew the quilt over his distended belly.

Wolf pinched the powder tin of face dust between claws and dabbed it along his muzzle to dull the sheen. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad. Spectacles perched awkwardly on his snout; lenses fogged, smudging the world to blur. Wolf fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.
