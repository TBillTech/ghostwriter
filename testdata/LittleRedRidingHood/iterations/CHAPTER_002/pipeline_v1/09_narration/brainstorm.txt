* Wolf advanced in a single, smooth bound that found the middle of the floor.
* Wolf opened wide; a swift upward tilt and Grandmother vanished in one bite.
* The chair tipped and clattered; a cup rattled in its saucer.
* The feather quilt lifted with the rush of air; curtains stirred and then stilled.
* The teapot went on sighing; only the kettle’s small hiss marked the silence.
* Wolf’s belly rounded, firm and high; floorboards groaned under the new heft.
* He did not falter; he tested his balance and rolled his shoulders once.
