The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room. The chair tipped and clattered; the cup rattled in its saucer. The feather quilt shuddered with a rush of air. Curtains stirred and then stilled, and the cottage convulsed in a small, domestic tumble—Grandmother's world set into motion and then arrested.

The Wolf stepped forward in a single, smooth bound that found the middle of the floor. A startled breath escaped Grandmother. The Wolf opened wide with a swift upward tilt and swallowed Grandmother whole in one smooth bite. The teapot sighed, and a hush filled the room.

The Wolf's belly rounded, firm and high; the floorboards groaned under the new heft as the Wolf tested his balance, rolled his shoulders once, smoothed powder across his muzzle, and arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened—pleasing work, patient as hunger.
