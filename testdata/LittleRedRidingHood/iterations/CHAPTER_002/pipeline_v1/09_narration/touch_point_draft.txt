The door eased inward and Wolf slipped through the gap like a shadow finding its shape. He paused on the threshold, scenting the warmth, counting heartbeats. Grandmother rose from her chair, one hand on the hazel stick, the other reaching toward the stove. Wolf crossed the hearthstones in two silent bounds, breath warm and intent. The floorboards creaked once; the chair tipped and skated, knocking the teacup askew.

A single gulp took Grandmother whole. The room answered with a thud of chair leg and a soft, settling sigh. The teapot kept its whisper; the spoon in the cup rattled and went still. Wolfâ€™s belly rounded, heavy beneath his ribs, and he adjusted his stance until the weight found its place. He didn't mind the weight in his belly. Wolf smoothed the feather quilt, tucked the Basket of Goodies beside him, and drew the quilt over his distended midsection.

He pinched the powder tin of face dust between claws and dabbed it along his muzzle to dull the sheen. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad. Spectacles perched awkwardly on his snout; lenses fogged, smudging the world to blur. Wolf fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.
