=== SYSTEM ===
You will order and refine brainstormed bullet points for coherent flow.

=== USER ===
You are a director examining the output of a creative brainstorming session, also working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is simply to order the bullets in the most logial sequence possible. You are not allowed to take bullets away.
You are however, allowed to add new intermediate bullets to help the sequence make more sense.

Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
The latch clicked; the kettle sighed. The Wolf purred, "Grandmother, it's me. Mama sent bread and jam." Grandmother murmured, "Come in, child. Sit by the stove — tea's hot. The hazel stick's by the door." The Wolf purred, "Take your time; I'll wait where the door is smallest."

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Inside, the Disguise', 'description': 'The aftermath of swallowing Grandma: The chair is knocked over, and the teapot is still warm.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Grandmother’s Nightcap and Spectacles', 'significance': 'Tools of disguise; innocence repurposed', 'description': 'A soft cap with a blue ribbon, and spectacles smudged with use.\nThey pinch the Wolf’s ears and blur his eyes, but lend him a silhouette.\n'}, {'name': 'Feather Quilt and Bed Curtains', 'significance': 'Stage for the masquerade', 'description': 'A puffed quilt stitched with strawberries, curtains that turn a bed into a small theater.\nThey muffle size and shape, smooth the outline of teeth.\n'}, {'name': 'Shutter Hook', 'significance': 'Conspiracy with the dark', 'description': 'A simple hook-and-eye that tames daylight.\nOnce fastened, the room agrees to keep secrets.\n'}, {'name': 'Powder Tin', 'significance': 'A trick to soften a snout', 'description': 'A little tin of rice powder; a dab on the muzzle keeps the fur from gleaming.\n'}]}

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide your results as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character.
2. **Clean Lines**: If there are intent words at the beginning of the given bullets, for example "Clarity - ", or "Flavor: " leave those out and just recover the point without a title.
3. **Just Bullets Output**: Strip off, ignore, and do not output any markdown or other formatting, other than just only '*' character at line start.

Now, Here are the Bullets to be ordered in as logical a way as possible:
* The door eased inward, and wolf slipped through the gap like a shadow finding its shape.
* Grandmother rose from her chair, one hand on the hazel stick, the other reaching toward the stove.
* The floorboards creaked once; the chair tipped and skated, knocking the tea-cup askew.
* Wolf crossed the hearth stones in two silent bounds, breath warm, intent neatly folded.
* A single gulp took Grandmother whole, swift as a lantern snuffed; the room answered with a thud of chair leg and a soft settling sigh.
* The teapot kept its whisper; the spoon in the cup rattled and went still.
* Wolf’s belly rounded, heavy beneath his ribs, and he adjusted his stance until the weight found its place.
* He fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.
* He pinched the powder tin between claws, dabbed rice dust along his muzzle to dim the telltale gleam.
* The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad for human comfort.
* Spectacles perched on a bridge made for scent, lenses fogging, smudges turning the world to blur.
* He smoothed the feather quilt, plumping strawberries into a hill that disguised his breadth.
* Wolf settled, belly distended under quilted fruit, untroubled by the burden as the cottage kept his secret.
