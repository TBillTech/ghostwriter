- Foreshadowing: 
- Prior paragraph (if any): The latch clicked; the kettle sighed. The Wolf purred, "Grandmother, it's me. Mama sent bread and jam." Grandmother murmured, "Come in, child. Sit by the stove — tea's hot. The hazel stick's by the door." The Wolf purred, "Take your time; I'll wait where the door is smallest."

Ordered bullets
===============
* The door eased inward, and wolf slipped through the gap like a shadow finding its shape.
* He paused on the threshold, scenting the warmth and counting heartbeats in the hush.
* Grandmother rose from her chair, one hand on the hazel stick, the other reaching toward the stove.
* Wolf crossed the hearth stones in two silent bounds, breath warm, intent neatly folded.
* The floorboards creaked once; the chair tipped and skated, knocking the tea-cup askew.
* A single gulp took Grandmother whole, swift as a lantern snuffed; the room answered with a thud of chair leg and a soft settling sigh.
* The teapot kept its whisper; the spoon in the cup rattled and went still.
* Wolf’s belly rounded, heavy beneath his ribs, and he adjusted his stance until the weight found its place.
* He smoothed the feather quilt, plumping strawberries into a hill that disguised his breadth.
* Wolf settled, belly distended under quilted fruit, untroubled by the burden as the cottage kept his secret.
* He pinched the powder tin between claws, dabbed rice dust along his muzzle to dim the telltale gleam.
* The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad for human comfort.
* Spectacles perched on a bridge made for scent, lenses fogging, smudges turning the world to blur.
* He fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.
