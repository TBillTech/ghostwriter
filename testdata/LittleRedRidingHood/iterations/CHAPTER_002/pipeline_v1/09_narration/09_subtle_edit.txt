You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. From the bramble a sleek wolf moved parallel, low and silent, lifting his muzzle to the trail as if to taste the drift of jam, and when Red paused he slid into speech with a velvet, honeyed voice that asked where she was bound and what treasures she carried, murmuring of a quicker way and offering to guide her by a narrow deer track that would rejoin the lane by the birch marked by a lightning scar; the forest listened—a jay cackled and vanished, a branch brushed the basket and made it creak, and shadows lengthened while the wolf's smile was all bright teeth and false comfort. He named the crooked stump and the three tall pines that marked her grandmother's cottage and, soft and insistent, assured her the deer track would set her right on time, letting the thought of a shortcut curl in the air like a lure. Red tightened her hood, fingers clamped the handles, felt the crooked stump's shadow skitter across her boots, and though she faltered at the fork and felt the hush press, she remembered her grandmother waiting, thanked him in a small voice, and—resolute not to linger for flowers—accepted the wolf’s guidance, stepping onto the narrow ruts and hurrying away along the hidden track.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines. The hood gleams in narrow bands of light as the path winds past the black-barked oak and the forest draws a shade around me; pine needles soften my steps and pale dust lifts in my wake while a tuft of blue flowers nods from the verge. I clutch the wicker when a branch brushes it and the crooked stump's shadow skitters over my boots, and when the wolf slips from the bramble his voice is velvet and his questions smell of honey and quicksilver. He asks where I'm bound, what treasures I carry, and offers a hushed shortcut along a deer track that will meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar—names I know, and promises that curl like a lure. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows make me flinch; still, thinking of Grandmother waiting with bread and jam, I tug my hood tighter, decide against lingering for flowers, and with a tightened grip on the basket and a small, steady stride I accept the deer track and hurry on, thanking him and calling farewell over my shoulder.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sit easy beneath my coat as I pad low through the bramble, smelling jam like an invitation threaded through the pines, watching her bright hood cut the light and the wicker creak like a small, honest drum. I slip between shadows and time my words soft as oil, letting polite curiosity tilt her answers toward the map I want to set in her head: three tall pines, the crooked stump, the birch with the lightning scar. I purr a promise of a quicker way, let the sibilants smear like a ribbon, and watch the branch that brushes her hand make the basket speak for me. The jay's cackle and the hush that follows do my work for me; hesitation blooms, memory of the birch tugs, and I press the deer-track into her choices like an easy route home. She tightens her hood, thanks me in a small voice, and follows the narrow ruts, fingers curled on the handle—I bow with a silk of a smile and wait, patient as hunger.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums and walks beneath my pines, the hood bright against the deepening shade where the black oak bends the trail. Tufted blue leans in my verge and pine needles hush her steps while a branch reaches to make the wicker creak; I let the sound fold into my long quiet. A sleek shape slips through my bramble, low and measured, tasting the jam that rides my air, and his voice slides over my understory like oil—soft questions, the offer of a narrow deer track that threads beneath my roots and promises to meet the lane by the birch with the lightning scar. The jay cackles and then the hush thickens, the crooked stump's shadow slides across her boots, and she pauses between my forks before tugging her hood tighter and stepping onto the thin ruts. I keep the crossing tucked in my soil as she hurries on, basket against her arm, the trail folding the moment into the long hush of the wood.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
Wolf enters, then swallows Grandma up in one bite. His belly is distended, but Wolf doesn't mind.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room. The chair tipped and clattered; the cup rattled in its saucer. The feather quilt shuddered with a rush of air, curtains stirred and then stilled, and the cottage convulsed in a small, domestic tumble—Grandmother's world set into motion and then arrested.

Wolf stepped forward in a single, smooth bound that found the middle of the floor. He opened wide with a swift upward tilt and Grandmother vanished in one bite. The teapot sighed on, the kettle's small hiss marking the thin seam of sound, and a hush filled the gaps between noises as if the room were reading its own quiet. Wolf's belly rounded, firm and high; the floorboards groaned under the new heft. Wolf did not falter. He tested his balance, rolled his shoulders once, dabbed powder along his muzzle, and arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened just so—pleasing work, patient as hunger.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace ambiguous pronouns with names in key moments (e.g., change “He opened wide…” and “He tested his balance…” to “The Wolf opened wide…” and “The Wolf tested his balance…”) to avoid momentary confusion about actors.

- Tighten redundant sound-detail sequence: simplify “The teapot sighed on, the kettle's small hiss marking the thin seam of sound, and a hush filled the gaps between noises” to a single, sharper image that maintains the hush (e.g., keep one vessel’s sound and the hush).

- Trim or rephrase “The floorboards groaned under the new heft. Wolf did not falter.” — these two lines are slightly repetitive. Either merge (showing balance under weight) or drop “did not falter” and show steadiness through action (balance, roll of shoulders).

- Soften or clarify “Grandmother vanished in one bite” if you want to preserve the writer’s sly tone while avoiding bluntness: consider “Grandmother was swallowed in a single, deft motion” or “The Wolf swallowed Grandmother whole in one smooth bite” — keep the swallow explicit but make cadence match the Wolf’s theatrical charm.

- Rework “dabbed powder along his muzzle” which reads slightly domestic and clumsy against the Wolf’s slick menace: choose a verb that keeps theatricality but reads cleaner (e.g., “smoothed powder,” “patted powder,” or “touched powder to his muzzle”).

- Shorten the closing clause “and arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened just so—pleasing work, patient as hunger.” Consider tightening cadence: “He arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened—pleasing work, patient as hunger.” This preserves voice but removes a double adverbial rhythm.

- Consider adding one brief micro-reaction from Grandmother (a startled breath, a muffled sound) before she is gone to sharpen the moment’s emotional impact — keep it extremely small so the Wolf’s swift triumph remains the focus.

- Watch for present-tense shifts: ensure all verbs consistently maintain the chosen tense (mostly past). For example, “The teapot sighed on” feels slightly off; consider “The teapot continued to sigh” or “The teapot sighed” for consistency.

- Keep the room-as-character language, but vary sentence length more deliberately: break one of the longer opening sentences into two to improve rhythm and give the swallowing moment more punch.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.
