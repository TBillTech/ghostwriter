# Characters in this chapter


# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
Wolf enters, then swallows Grandma up in one bite. His belly is distended, but Wolf doesn't mind.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The door eased inward and Wolf slipped through the gap like a shadow finding its shape. He paused on the threshold, scenting the warmth and counting heartbeats in the hush. Grandmother rose from her chair, one hand on the hazel stick, the other reaching toward the stove. Wolf crossed the hearthstones in two silent bounds, breath warm, intent neatly folded. The floorboards creaked once; the chair tipped and skated, knocking the teacup askew.

A single gulp took Grandmother whole, swift as a lantern snuffed; the room answered with a thud of chair leg and a soft, settling sigh. The teapot kept its whisper; the spoon in the cup rattled and went still. Wolf’s belly rounded, heavy beneath his ribs, and he adjusted his stance until the weight found its place. He smoothed the feather quilt, plumping strawberries into a hill that disguised his breadth. Wolf settled, belly distended under quilted fruit, untroubled by the burden as the cottage kept his secret. He pinched the powder tin between claws, dabbed rice dust along the muzzle to dim the telltale gleam. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad for human comfort. Spectacles perched on a bridge made for scent, lenses fogging, smudges turning the world to blur. He fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace ambiguous pronouns with names where needed (e.g., change sentence-initial "He paused..." / "He smoothed..." / "He pinched..." to "Wolf paused...", "Wolf smoothed...", "Wolf pinched...").

- Remove or replace the "plumping strawberries into a hill" image (inconsistent with Factoids). Either remove the strawberry image or replace it with items from the Basket of Goodies (bread and jam) to match setting.

- Clarify what the "powder tin" contains and why Wolf uses it (a single short phrase, e.g., "powder tin of face dust" or "powder tin to dull his muzzle's sheen") so the disguise action reads clearly.

- Tighten or simplify overwrought metaphors that obscure action (examples to shorten: "scenting the warmth and counting heartbeats in the hush," "swift as a lantern snuffed," "breath warm, intent neatly folded") — keep one or two evocative lines, remove redundant flourishes to preserve pacing.

- Adjust the quilt/fruit/belly phrasing for clarity and consistency (e.g., "Wolf's belly rounded beneath the quilt" or "he tucked the basket and drew the quilt over his distended belly") — avoid mixed images that suggest both fruit hill and stuffed belly.

- Make the disguise details succinct and chronological: powder tin → nightcap → ribbon → spectacles → fasten shutter. Remove any ambiguous or anatomically contradictory phrases (e.g., "brow too broad for human comfort" can be shortened to "brow too broad").

- Ensure no other characters speak or are introduced; replace any lines that might imply Grandmother speaks after being swallowed (none present now, but watch for future drafts).

- Optionally, add one short line confirming Wolf's indifference to the weight to align explicitly with the touch-point ("Wolf didn't mind the weight in his belly.") if you want the touch-point emphasis to be unmistakable.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.

Wolf’s belly rounded, heavy beneath his ribs, and he adjusted his stance until the weight found its place. Wolf didn't mind the weight in his belly. Wolf smoothed the feather quilt, tucked the Basket of Goodies beside him, and drew the quilt over his distended belly.

Wolf pinched the powder tin of face dust between claws and dabbed it along his muzzle to dull the sheen. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad. Spectacles perched awkwardly on his snout; lenses fogged, smudging the world to blur. Wolf fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.
