You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
The latch clicked. Somewhere inside, the kettle sighed. Warm air, mint and ash, spilled from the doorway; the moment held, equal parts invitation and caution.

Wolf paused, whiskers twitching. "How pleasant—your cottage always smells of good things. Shall I shut the door, or leave it a breath for you?"

Grandmother, shawl tightened, urged, "Close the door, dear. There's a chill—let the latch hold."

The floorboards welcomed a weight they had not known, and the room altered its breath to meet it. Mint-scented air held an unasked question.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
Wolf enters, then swallows Grandma up in one bite. His belly is distended, but Wolf doesn't mind.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room. The chair tipped and clattered; the cup rattled in its saucer. The feather quilt shuddered with a rush of air. Curtains stirred and then stilled, and the cottage convulsed in a small, domestic tumble—Grandmother's world set into motion and then arrested.

The Wolf stepped forward in a single, smooth bound that found the middle of the floor. A startled breath escaped Grandmother. The Wolf opened wide with a swift upward tilt and swallowed Grandmother whole in one smooth bite. The teapot sighed, and a hush filled the room.

The Wolf's belly rounded, firm and high; the floorboards groaned under the new heft as the Wolf tested his balance, rolled his shoulders once, smoothed powder across his muzzle, and arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened—pleasing work, patient as hunger.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Tighten first sentence rhythm: merge or trim two clauses ("The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room.")—make it crisper to heighten momentum into the Wolf's entrance.

- Vary sentence lengths in the second paragraph: break "The Wolf stepped forward..." sentence into two shorter beats before the swallow to increase tension (e.g., one sentence for the Wolf's approach, one for Grandmother's breath, then the swallow).

- Make the swallowing beat more sensory and immediate: add one concrete sound or tactile image (a single crisp verb like "snapped" or "closed") to sharpen the moment.

- Clarify the wolf-as-disguise action: change "arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened" to something more active and characterful that preserves his theatricality (e.g., "perched the nightcap, nudged the spectacles, folded his ears until his silhouette softened into something grandmotherly").

- Emphasize that the Wolf is unfazed by his distended belly (to match the touch-point) with one small, characterful next clause or sentence rather than stating it plainly—use his cadence/voice or a small action (a satisfied tilt of the head, a low chuckle, a teasing aside).

- Replace or clarify "smoothed powder across his muzzle": make the action feel wolfish and manipulative (e.g., "puffed a theatrical dusting of powder across his muzzle") so it reads as performance, not a domestic habit.

- Consider adding a single, short line of Wolf dialogue in his established cadence immediately after he arranges the disguise—keeps voice alive and signals intent while staying within allowed speakers (e.g., sly, teasing suggestion or faux concern).

- Trim or tighten passive domestic imagery that slows the scene (e.g., "The teapot sighed, and a hush filled the room.")—either make it sharper or cut it to maintain forward motion.

- Watch pronoun proximity: ensure "he" and "his" clearly refer to the Wolf in the line where he tests balance and smooths powder (if confusion possible, replace with "the Wolf" once).

- Optional: if you want more menace without being explicit, add a tiny sensory detail of the belly (a slow, satisfied ripple or soft thud against floorboards) rather than more explanation—keeps the image vivid and concise.
