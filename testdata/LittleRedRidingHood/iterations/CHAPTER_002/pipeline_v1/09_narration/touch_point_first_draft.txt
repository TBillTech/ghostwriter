The door eased inward and Wolf slipped through the gap like a shadow finding its shape. He paused on the threshold, scenting the warmth and counting heartbeats in the hush. Grandmother rose from her chair, one hand on the hazel stick, the other reaching toward the stove. Wolf crossed the hearthstones in two silent bounds, breath warm, intent neatly folded. The floorboards creaked once; the chair tipped and skated, knocking the teacup askew.

A single gulp took Grandmother whole, swift as a lantern snuffed; the room answered with a thud of chair leg and a soft, settling sigh. The teapot kept its whisper; the spoon in the cup rattled and went still. Wolfâ€™s belly rounded, heavy beneath his ribs, and he adjusted his stance until the weight found its place. He smoothed the feather quilt, plumping strawberries into a hill that disguised his breadth. Wolf settled, belly distended under quilted fruit, untroubled by the burden as the cottage kept his secret. He pinched the powder tin between claws, dabbed rice dust along the muzzle to dim the telltale gleam. The nightcap slid over pricked ears; the blue ribbon bowed above a brow too broad for human comfort. Spectacles perched on a bridge made for scent, lenses fogging, smudges turning the world to blur. He fastened the shutter hook, letting the room trade daylight for secrecy and lamplight gloss.
