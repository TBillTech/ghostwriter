The latch clicked shut and warm mint and ash breathed from the small room. The chair tipped and clattered; the cup rattled in its saucer. The feather quilt shuddered with a rush of air, curtains stirred and then stilled, and the cottage convulsed in a small, domestic tumble—Grandmother's world set into motion and then arrested.

Wolf stepped forward in a single, smooth bound that found the middle of the floor. He opened wide with a swift upward tilt and Grandmother vanished in one bite. The teapot sighed on, the kettle's small hiss marking the thin seam of sound, and a hush filled the gaps between noises as if the room were reading its own quiet. Wolf's belly rounded, firm and high; the floorboards groaned under the new heft. Wolf did not falter. He tested his balance, rolled his shoulders once, dabbed powder along his muzzle, and arranged the nightcap and spectacles until the outline softened just so—pleasing work, patient as hunger.
