=== SYSTEM ===
You write third-person narrative prose without quotation marks.

=== USER ===
You are writing third-person narrative prose that bridges or frames the surrounding dialog.

Rules:
- Do not use quotation marks.
- Keep the voice consistent with the current chapter’s style and scene.
- Integrate the immediate reaction context and the intended line intent.
- Be concise but evocative. Just a sentence or two. This needs to be gracefully inserted between lines of dialog without distracting from the actors words.
- Avoid actor attributions; this is narration, not a spoken line.

Context (may be partial and pre-formatted):

{'factoids': ["Grandmother's Cottage", 'Forest Path', 'Basket of Goodies', 'Red Hood'], 'actors': ['The Wolf', 'Grandmother']}

Scene: {'name': 'At the Cottage Gate', 'description': 'Having slipped from the deer track ahead of Red, the Wolf reaches a small cottage tucked in thyme and smoke.\nThe garden is a patchwork of herbs and cabbages, the door sun-bleached and simple; inside, a kettle hums and an old clock ticks.\nThe world here smells of mint and ash and rest, vulnerable in its quiet routine.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Cottage Door-Latch', 'significance': 'Threshold of trust; a simple defense turned invitation', 'description': 'A thumb-worn iron latch, warm from afternoon light.\nIt answers to a familiar knock and an even more familiar voice.\n'}, {'name': 'Hearth and Kettle', 'significance': 'Homeliness to be imitated; cover for small sounds', 'description': 'A blackened iron kettle keeps time in soft breaths over banked coals,\nits steam sewing the room together with the smell of nettle tea.\n'}, {'name': 'Teacup on Saucer', 'significance': 'Grandmother’s pause interrupted', 'description': 'Porcelain with a hairline crack, rim blushed by tea.\nIt waits beside a chair draped with a shawl.\n'}, {'name': 'Walking Stick', 'significance': 'Measure of frailty the Wolf will exploit', 'description': 'A hazel stick, polished by years of palms, leaning by the door.\n'}]}

Agenda notes (may be empty):


Immediate cues:
- Line intent: You let the room's mint and ash greet what smells of pine and rain, and you do not name the teeth.
- Reaction to previous line: You let the room's mint and ash hang in the air and note the absence of any named teeth, as if scent could hold its tongue.

Write the narrative prose now (no quotes):

=== RESPONSE ===
The room greets the moment with mint and ash, the pine and rain outside echoing softly; the air holds its tongue where teeth should be, letting the space choose its pace.
