# Characters in this chapter


# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The Wolf purred, "That small latch click speaks softly to us both. Come with me to a quieter door, where you can pace the moment and decide on your own terms." Grandmother murmured, "Come in, dear. Sit by the stove awhile; today’s just a quiet visit. I’ve left my hazel walking stick by the door to keep things ordinary." The Wolf, smoothing his voice, purred again, "That latch keeps time with our breath, does it not? The hazel stick in your hand is a plain thing—the sort of ordinary tool that makes a quieter door feel safer. Come with me at your pace, and you’ll decide on your own terms." Grandmother, slow and deliberate, answered, "Well, hello there, dear. Make yourself comfortable by the stove; there’s tea to pour and a warm biscuit waiting. I’ve left my hazel walking stick by the door to keep things ordinary for now."

The room greets the moment with mint and ash, the pine and rain outside echoing softly; the air holds its tongue where teeth should be, letting the space choose its pace. The Wolf paused and said, "That latch keeps time with our breath; I’ll move at your pace and step through when you’re ready. Let the quiet guide us; a moment shared is a moment earned. Whenever you’re ready, we’ll take the door and see where it leads." The clock hand slides its measured arc, counting the breath between tapping moments and the quiet that follows each pause. Patience gathers at the door like thyme and smoke, pacing the space until the next knock becomes more invitation than interruption.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove redundant lines that repeat the same image or phrase:
  - Delete one of the Wolf’s repeated "that latch keeps time with our breath" passages (keep only a single, sharper version).
  - Remove the second instance of Grandmother mentioning "I’ve left my hazel walking stick by the door" (keep it once, earlier or later, not both).

- Cut long, poetic narration that reads like stage direction rather than dialogue:
  - Remove the paragraph beginning "The room greets the moment with mint and ash..." — compress its essential atmosphere into one short, spoken or implied image instead.

- Tighten the Wolf’s dialogue to be fewer, more suggestive lines:
  - Replace verbose Wolf lines with one concise line that implies mimicry and coaxing. Example replacement: The Wolf (softly), "Open up, dear — a quiet visit, bread and jam." Then follow with one sly line: "Take your time; I’ll wait where the door is smallest."
  - Avoid the Wolf describing rhythm/metaphor twice; choose either the "latch keeps time" image or the "quiet guide us" image, not both.

- Make Grandmother’s speech more character-specific and less explanatory:
  - Replace long polite announcements with warm, slightly raspy, short phrases. Example: "Come in, child. Sit by the stove — tea’s hot." Keep only one mention of the walking stick as a grounding detail: "The hazel stick’s by the door."

- Remove meta-descriptive constructions where characters narrate their own actions or inner states:
  - Delete lines like "The Wolf, smoothing his voice, purred again" and "Grandmother, slow and deliberate, answered" — instead show through the line itself (use simple speech tag: The Wolf purred, "..." or Grandmother murmured, "...").

- Reduce overly literal or awkward similes and metaphors:
  - Remove phrases such as "The latch speaks softly to us both" and "Patience gathers at the door like thyme and smoke." If needed, replace with a single simple sensory image: "The latch clicked; the cottage smelled of thyme and tea."

- Preserve the touch-point subtlety (do not state the foreshadowing explicitly):
  - Keep any mention of the latch and kettle faint and indirect; ensure no line declares the cottage's ignorance of danger. Replace any explicit claim about "the cottage does not yet recognize the weight of a predator" with quieter wording or implication (e.g., Grandmother's voice is untroubled; the kettle sighs).

- Dialogue length and balance:
  - Aim for short exchanges: alternate one-line Wolf coaxing, one-line Grandmother reply, then one brief Wolf follow-up. Eliminate long monologues by both characters.

- Final suggested rearrangement (concise example to follow when rewriting):
  - Wolf (soft): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam."
  - Grandmother (raspy, warm): "Lift the latch, child. Come in and sit by the stove — tea’s waiting."
  - Wolf (purring): "I’ll wait at the smaller door." (optional single closing tug)

Implement these cuts and swaps to remove repetition, reduce narration, keep speech natural, and preserve the scene’s subtle tension.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.
