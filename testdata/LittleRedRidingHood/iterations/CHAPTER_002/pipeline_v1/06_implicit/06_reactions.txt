=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You let the latch give a small, polite click and you smile, keeping your teeth carefully hidden.

grandma: You notice the hazel walking stick leaning where you left it, and you tell yourself today is ordinary.

wolf: You smooth the child's lilt a shade too carefully, as if tying a bow twice, and you purr the softened words.

grandma: You hear the word "dear" and you miss the breath that shapes it, answering with a slow, warm, "Come in, dear."

Narrator: You let the room's mint and ash greet what smells of pine and rain, and you do not name the teeth.

wolf: You pause just long enough to seem dutiful—an obedient beat—and you let the pause do the persuading.

Narrator: You watch the clock hand move on while you count, silently, how far until the next knock would be too late.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
grandma: You hear that small, polite click and smooth your breath into the ordinary—today, you tell yourself, is just a visit.
wolf: You catch the mention of the hazel stick and fold it into conversation like a prop; you let the thought of ordinariness be something to soften against.
grandma: You feel the softened lilt as if it were a bow at the throat of a tune, and you answer with a warm, deliberate welcome.
Narrator: You let the room's mint and ash hang in the air and note the absence of any named teeth, as if scent could hold its tongue.
wolf: You let that quiet—mint and ash, unnamed teeth—settle into the space and trust the pause to do the coaxing for you.
Narrator: You watch the clock hand and count the beats that stretch toward an unmade knock, cataloguing how patience and timing might be answered.
