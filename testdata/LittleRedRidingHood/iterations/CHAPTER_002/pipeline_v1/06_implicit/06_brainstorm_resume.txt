=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm implicit dialog beats (indirect, subtext) as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, but to do it indirectly!
Ask yourself, what points could be of great interest to the audience, and be inferred from the touch-point. Come up with creative ideas that are small pieces of the touch-point, but be cagey and don't just dump the idea on the reader.
For example, it may help to imagine that the audience might be offended by just coming out and saying it.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
A kettle hummed inside the cottage. Wolf leaned close to the door and, soft and breathy, mimicked Red. "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?" From within, muffled with age, Grandmother answered, "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting." The latch lifted. Grandmother, warm and a little raspy, said, "Come in, dear. Sit by the stove."

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'At the Cottage Gate', 'description': 'Having slipped from the deer track ahead of Red, the Wolf reaches a small cottage tucked in thyme and smoke.\nThe garden is a patchwork of herbs and cabbages, the door sun-bleached and simple; inside, a kettle hums and an old clock ticks.\nThe world here smells of mint and ash and rest, vulnerable in its quiet routine.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Cottage Door-Latch', 'significance': 'Threshold of trust; a simple defense turned invitation', 'description': 'A thumb-worn iron latch, warm from afternoon light.\nIt answers to a familiar knock and an even more familiar voice.\n'}, {'name': 'Hearth and Kettle', 'significance': 'Homeliness to be imitated; cover for small sounds', 'description': 'A blackened iron kettle keeps time in soft breaths over banked coals,\nits steam sewing the room together with the smell of nettle tea.\n'}, {'name': 'Teacup on Saucer', 'significance': 'Grandmother’s pause interrupted', 'description': 'Porcelain with a hairline crack, rim blushed by tea.\nIt waits beside a chair draped with a shawl.\n'}, {'name': 'Walking Stick', 'significance': 'Measure of frailty the Wolf will exploit', 'description': 'A hazel stick, polished by years of palms, leaning by the door.\n'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
The, Wolf, Grandmother

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be artfully danced around:
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.



# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Indirectly alluding to this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to suggest things to the readers mind, with the goal of making the touch point seem to emerge like an aha-moment. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.

=== RESPONSE ===
* The latch gives a small, polite click that makes wolf smile with his teeth still hidden.
* The kettle’s breath seems to approve, and wolf lets his voice ride its steam.
* The floorboard nearest the door accepts a weight it doesn’t know and only sighs for the stove.
* The hazel walking stick leans where grandma left it, unconsulted, as if today is ordinary.
* The clock keeps its patient count and misses the way wolf stands between ticks.
* wolf smooths the child’s lilt a shade too carefully, like a bow tied twice.
* grandma hears the word dear and not the breath that shapes it.
* The room’s mint and ash welcome what smells of pine and rain, not teeth.
* The teacup’s hairline crack warms again, mistaking company for comfort.
* wolf pauses just long enough to seem dutiful, not long enough to be measured.
* The rug by the door bunches a little different and nobody scolds it flat.
* The latch’s warmth from the sun transfers to wolf’s paw and pretends it is a hand.
* grandma says, “Mind the draft,” and wolf obliges the window while ignoring the door behind him.
* The kettle lifts its lid a whisper, covering the small sound wolf makes setting something aside.
* wolf repeats grandma’s phrasing back to her, trimmed like hedges along a familiar path.
* The floor gives a low note under wolf, and grandma calls it the old house’s song.
* The garden thyme forgets to bristle; its scent curls in welcome around an unfamiliar ankle.
* wolf glances at the walking stick and adds a cough to his borrowed voice.
* grandma reaches for the shawl, not the latch, trusting the first to do the second’s work.
* The hearth’s heat takes wolf’s shadow and folds it into the chair’s shadow, indistinguishable.
* wolf says, “Only a moment, of course,” and the room learns to make room.
* The clock hand moves on; wolf counts how far until the next knock would be too late.
