=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You let the latch give a small, polite click and you smile, keeping your teeth carefully hidden.

grandma: You notice the hazel walking stick leaning where you left it, and you tell yourself today is ordinary.

wolf: You smooth the child's lilt a shade too carefully, as if tying a bow twice, and you purr the softened words.

grandma: You hear the word "dear" and you miss the breath that shapes it, answering with a slow, warm, "Come in, dear."

Narrator: You let the room's mint and ash greet what smells of pine and rain, and you do not name the teeth.

wolf: You pause just long enough to seem dutiful—an obedient beat—and you let the pause do the persuading.

Narrator: You watch the clock hand move on while you count, silently, how far until the next knock would be too late.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf:
* You intend to persuade and to possess: your speech is a tool to open doors and arrangements without force.
* You speak to cultivate trust; each softness is designed to shorten suspicion and lengthen opportunity.
* You want access to seclusion and time alone with your quarry; you seek control of the tempo of the interaction.
* You hide appetite behind civility—your true aim (to take advantage of an unguarded moment) is veiled by concern.
* You aim to learn small facts (routes, habits, delays) that will let you plan the next move; questions are bait.
* Your immediate motivation is to nudge the other toward choices that favor shortcuts and solitude.
* Your mood is composed hunger: patient, theatrical, and mildly amused at how smoothly a pliant reply will follow.
* You use pauses, flattering echoes, and faux-dutifulness as instruments: they are calculated to soothe and to steer.
* You avoid direct threat; you prefer the quiet collapse of resistance into compliance.

grandma:
* You intend to preserve ordinary comfort and the ritual of welcome; your voice is a bridge to continuity.
* You speak from habit and from a wish to reassure both yourself and your guest; hospitality steadies a worried mind.
* You want safety and calm—first for yourself, then for those you care for; routine is your defense against unease.
* You downplay any flicker of alarm; any worry is softened into practical care so as not to alarm others.
* Your immediate motivation is to welcome and to check small facts that confirm familiar patterns (who has come, why, whether all is as expected).
* You are trying to keep the encounter within known boundaries: conversation that settles rather than probes.
* Your mood is warm and measured with an undertow of caution: fondness and habitual trust mingle with brief, private vigilance.
* You offer gentleness and small tasks (inward or spoken) as a way to restore normalcy and to measure intent.
* You avoid harshness; firmness appears only as quiet concern, not accusation.
