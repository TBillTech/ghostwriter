Red walks the forest path, humming, basket in hand.
END_TOUCHPOINT
BEGIN_RESULT
Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, her red hood bright against the pines, a basket in her hand. She hummed a small, steady tune; the wicker creaked softly with each swing. Inside: bread and jam for Grandmother. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; birds stirred in the boughs and a lift of air carried the jam-sweet scent from the basket toward the bracken. Pine needles softened every footfall. She passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on.

Wolf paced just inside the bracken, keeping parallel to her course; the forest hid Wolf's paws and breath. The scents reached Wolf when the wind favored him, and he matched her stride—moving silently when she moved, pausing when she paused—following at a careful distance.

The Wolf greets Red and asks where she's going.
END_TOUCHPOINT
BEGIN_RESULT
The Wolf bowed. "Good day, little one. Where are you headed? That basket gives you away. The woods have many paths—if you trust a guide, I can show you a quicker route."

Red clutched her basket. "To my grandmother’s cottage. Bread and jam for her. I’ll stay on the path."

The Wolf smiled. "Nice hood. Bright enough to spot from here."

Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.
END_TOUCHPOINT
BEGIN_RESULT
The Wolf said, "Good day, little one. Where are you headed? That basket promises a noble errand—if you'd trust a patient guide, I can show a quicker way through the pines." His smile was too smooth.

Little Red blinked. "To my grandmother's cottage—bread and jam. I'll stay on the path." She straightened, basket held a little tighter, and the forest listened.

The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.
END_TOUCHPOINT
BEGIN_RESULT
"I know a deer track that will get you there faster. Trust me—I'll guide you."

Red clutched her basket tighter. "Mother told me to stay on the path, but Grandmother needs this basket. All right—I'll try the shortcut."

The Wolf gestured toward the narrow, mossy track. "This way."

Red hesitated, then said, "Very well. Lead the way." She stepped onto the track and followed him.
