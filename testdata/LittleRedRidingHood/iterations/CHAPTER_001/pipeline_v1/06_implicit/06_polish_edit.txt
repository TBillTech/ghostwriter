# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf purred. "Good day, little one. Where are you headed? The woods can be kinder with a guide."

Little Red blinked. "To my grandmother's cottage. I'm bringing her bread and jam; I must hurry and stay on the path."

The Wolf chuckled. "A noble errand. There are shrewd shortcuts through the pines—faster ways for those who care to try. Just a friendly offer, if you'd like company."

Little Red straightened. "No, thank you. I'll stay on the path."

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.
