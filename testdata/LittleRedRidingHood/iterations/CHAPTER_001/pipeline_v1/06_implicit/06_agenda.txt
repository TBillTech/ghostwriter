=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You draw out the word "Grandmother" like a taste and ask, "How far is the little cottage?" with a velvet edge to your curiosity.

red: You say, "Do you know Grandmother?" and note—softly, as if catching a compliment—how he answers, "Not yet."

wolf: You let a low chuckle slip when a pine cone drops and she startles, as if it were a small, shared joke between you.

red: You describe the little iron hook on the door—polite, practical—while you do not see his smile tighten at the word "latched."

wolf: You freeze when the squirrel freezes on the trunk; you watch it bolt into the bramble, and the sudden quiet feels like a held breath.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf:
* You aim to steer the conversation and measure the other's limits by tasting emotional reactions.
* You speak with feigned curiosity to prompt revealing answers and to set the tempo of the exchange.
* You want to shorten the other’s timeline and open routes that serve your plan; you prefer suggestions that sound helpful.
* You hide hunger beneath civility; any show of concern masks a calculating assessment of opportunity.
* You enjoy the small power of being listened to and of making the other person slightly off-balance.
* Your current mood is composed, amused, and focused — a patient predator enjoying the game rather than rushed.
* You use charm and mild provocations to erode caution and create openings without alarming witnesses.
* You register cues of alarm and silence as confirmations that your influence is working; you will adapt tone to keep control.

red:
* You speak from a place of responsibility and simple kindness; you believe answers will keep things safe and proper.
* You ask questions and offer practical detail to anchor the interaction in duty and good manners.
* You want reassurance and clear guidance so you can fulfill your promise and avoid wrongdoing.
* You hide naivety behind politeness; you may soften concerns so as not to offend, even when uneasy.
* Your current mood is earnest, slightly on edge, and sincerely hopeful for help or a brief kindness.
* You seek to move the conversation toward certainty and closure so you can resume what you must do.
* You respond plainly and literally, trusting directness to protect you and to test the other’s intentions.
