# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf purred, "Grandmother, how far is the little cottage? I like to measure a path by whispers before I step forward.?"
Little Red blinked, "Do you know Grandmother??"
The Wolf chuckled, "Not far, little traveler; the cottage lies where the pines murmur, and I worry for your steps. Would you like me to show you a quicker way, one that keeps your footprints light and your good intentions intact? Only a suggestion, of course: your mother needn't know.."
Little Red noted, "Yes, I know Grandmother. She is my grandmother, and I bring her these goodies to help her feel better. Please, I must hurry to her and stay on the path.."
The Wolf froze, "A quicker path, is that what you seek? 
I know doors that yield to a whispered word and a latch that answers only to a careful touch. 
Every shortcut bears a price, and some doors stay latched unless you’re prepared to pay the toll.."

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.

Little Red blinked. "Do you know Grandmother?"

The Wolf chuckled. "Not far, little traveler; the cottage lies where the pines murmur, and I worry for your steps. Would you like me to show you a quicker way, one that keeps your footprints light and your good intentions intact? Only a suggestion, of course—your mother needn't know."

Little Red noted, "Yes, I know Grandmother. She is my grandmother, and I bring her these goodies to help her feel better. Please, I must hurry to her and stay on the path."

The Wolf froze. "A quicker path, is that what you seek? I know doors that yield to a whispered word and a latch that answers only to a careful touch. Every shortcut bears a price, and some doors stay latched unless you’re prepared to pay the toll."
