=== SYSTEM ===
Assign dialog lines to actors as 'id: line' entries.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* wolf repeats red’s word “Grandmother” as if tasting it, then asks how far “the little cottage” might be.
* red asks, “Do you know Grandmother?” and wolf says, “Not yet,” like it is a compliment.
* A pine cone drops; red startles, and wolf chuckles like it was a shared joke.
* He asks if Grandmother keeps her door latched “against drafts,” and red answers about the little iron hook without seeing his smile tighten.
* A squirrel freezes on a trunk, eyes wide; red waves, while wolf freezes too. Suddenly the squirrel bolts into bramble.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You draw out the word "Grandmother" like a taste and ask, "How far is the little cottage?" with a velvet edge to your curiosity.

red: You say, "Do you know Grandmother?" and note—softly, as if catching a compliment—how he answers, "Not yet."

wolf: You let a low chuckle slip when a pine cone drops and she startles, as if it were a small, shared joke between you.

red: You describe the little iron hook on the door—polite, practical—while you do not see his smile tighten at the word "latched."

wolf: You freeze when the squirrel freezes on the trunk; you watch it bolt into the bramble, and the sudden quiet feels like a held breath.
