Red clutched the basket. "Thank you for your kindness. I’ll hurry to Grandmother now and keep to the safe path. I’ll do my best to be brave."

The wolf purred, "Bright hood you wear, child—the forest itself seems to lean closer. I’ll walk with you a stretch if you share that tiny secret; such small truths have a way of smoothing the road. Trust a patient listener, and the way to Grandmother’s door may open a little wider."

A bird lifted its song on the thin air, then halted as a sudden turn of the head cut the thread; the forest held its breath and listened alongside them. The moment settled into a hush, as if the trees themselves waited for the next small truth to unfold on the path ahead.

Red thanked him softly. "Thank you for your kindness. Please forgive me, but I must hurry to Grandmother now and stay on the safe path," she added, clutching her basket a little tighter.

The wolf stepped forward. "Your courage lights the path, little traveler. Which road toward Grandmother’s house do you mean to take? I’ll walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me—my hunger ticking softly in the shade as we go."

A pine needle dropped between them, its quiet arc measuring the hush as surely as a clock hand; the wolf’s gaze pierced the space, weighing truth against tread. The moment landed, and Red moved with the safe path in mind, the basket sweet with bread and jam, a quiet beacon of intent.

She curtsied. "Please forgive me; I must hurry to Grandmother now and stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I’ll go straight to Grandmother and do my best to be brave."
