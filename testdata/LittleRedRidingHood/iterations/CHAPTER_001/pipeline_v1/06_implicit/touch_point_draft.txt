The Wolf purred, "Good day, little one. Where are you headed? The woods can be kinder with a guide."

Little Red blinked. "To my grandmother's cottage. I'm bringing her bread and jam; I must hurry and stay on the path."

The Wolf chuckled. "A noble errand. There are shrewd shortcuts through the pinesâ€”faster ways for those who care to try. Just a friendly offer, if you'd like company."

Little Red straightened. "No, thank you. I'll stay on the path."
