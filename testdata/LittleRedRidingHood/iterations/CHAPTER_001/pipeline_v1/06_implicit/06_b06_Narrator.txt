=== SYSTEM ===
You write third-person narrative prose without quotation marks.

=== USER ===
You are writing third-person narrative prose that bridges or frames the surrounding dialog.

Rules:
- Do not use quotation marks.
- Keep the voice consistent with the current chapter’s style and scene.
- Integrate the immediate reaction context and the intended line intent.
- Be concise but evocative. Just a sentence or two. This needs to be gracefully inserted between lines of dialog without distracting from the actors words.
- Avoid actor attributions; this is narration, not a spoken line.

    "Further into the pines, beyond the bend by the big stump, is the path I must take. I’ll hurry straight to Grandmother now, and I’ll stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I must not waste any more time.",
    "Thank you for your kindness; I’ll hurry to Grandmother now and keep to the safe path. I’ll do my best to be brave.",
    "Thank you for your kindness. Please forgive me, but I must hurry to Grandmother now and stay on the safe path, clutching my basket a little tighter."

    "From the shade I speak, child—your courage shines as bright as the moon. Which road toward grandmother’s house do you mean to take, and I’ll walk with you a stretch, if you share a tiny secret with me.",
    "Well met, brave little traveler. Which way are you bound toward Grandmother’s house, and I’ll walk with you for a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me.",
    "Such courage shines in you, little one—your steps are guided by a moonlit thread. Which road toward Grandmother’s house are you bound for, and would you let a patient listener walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me?",
    "Bread and jam drift to me on the night air, sweet enough to loosen a wary heart. Which road toward Grandmother's house will you take, and may I walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me?",
    "That red hood brightens this dark wood, little traveler—such a soft glow that even shadows lean closer. Walk with me a stretch, and you may share a tiny secret; I’ll listen with patience and keep your pace steady.",
    "That warmth deserves a straight, unhurried path. Is Grandmother's house nearby, or must we walk a while to reach it?",
    "Bright hood you wear, child—the forest itself seems to lean closer. I’ll walk with you a stretch if you share that tiny secret; such small truths have a way of smoothing the road. Trust a patient listener, and the way to Grandmother’s door may open a little wider.",
    "Your courage lights the path, little traveler. Which road toward Grandmother’s house do you mean to take, and I’ll walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me—my hunger ticking softly in the shade as we go?"

=== RESPONSE ===
A pine needle drops between them, its quiet arc measuring the hush as surely as a clock hand; the wolf’s gaze needles the space, weighing truth against tread. The moment lands and Red moves with the safe path in mind, the basket sweet with bread and jam a quiet beacon of intent.
