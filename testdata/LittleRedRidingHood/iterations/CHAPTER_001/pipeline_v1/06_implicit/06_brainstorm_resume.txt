=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm implicit dialog beats (indirect, subtext) as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, but to do it indirectly!
Ask yourself, what points could be of great interest to the audience, and be inferred from the touch-point. Come up with creative ideas that are small pieces of the touch-point, but be cagey and don't just dump the idea on the reader.
For example, it may help to imagine that the audience might be offended by just coming out and saying it.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
"Further into the pines, beyond the bend by the big stump, is the path I must take," Red said, steadying the basket. "I'll hurry straight to Grandmother now, and I'll stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I must not waste any more time."

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be artfully danced around:
Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Indirectly alluding to this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to suggest things to the readers mind, with the goal of making the touch point seem to emerge like an aha-moment.

=== RESPONSE ===
* red brightens her voice, but her knuckles whiten on the basket handle.
* wolf praises the red hood, lingering on the word bright like a lick of honey.
* A bird begins a song, then snaps silent as wolf turns his head.
* red thanks him again, the word now a small shield rather than a bow.
* wolf steps half into the path and half into shadow, as if weighing which suits him.
* The jam’s sweet smell seems too loud when the wind tilts toward wolf.
* red repeats safe path like a promise to herself, not a lesson to him.
* wolf chuckles softly at hurry, as if he can see time folding another way.
* A pine needle drops between them; wolf’s eyes follow it down like a clock hand.
* red offers a tiny curtsy she didn’t mean to, then doesn’t pass by.
* wolf tilts his head, a single tooth in his smile catching a thread of light.
* The path forks only in the way shadows make it seem so; wolf looks at the darker bend.
* red shifts her basket to the far arm, a polite move that makes distance.
* wolf repeats Grandmother with a gentle sigh, savoring the word as if tasting it.
* The wind presses the hood against red’s cheek; it feels like a warning disguised as a kiss.
* wolf wonders aloud if the basket is heavy; his paw is already hovering like a solution.
* red says please excuse me, though no one has blocked her, and then notices that he has.
* wolf glances at the low brambles and smiles, as though they are doors that open for him.
* A twig snaps behind red with no one there; wolf does not look back.
* red offers a flower she picked, half apology, half delay; wolf breathes it in without touching it.
* wolf mentions a quicker way, soft as a secret, and the birds rustle like paper being folded shut.
* red nods too many times and takes a tiny step that is not forward.
* wolf assures her that mothers love good surprises; the word love lands cool on damp earth.
* The hood’s ribbon brushes red’s throat; she swallows and says thank you as if to the trees.
* wolf’s shadow joins hers for a heartbeat longer than the light would suggest.
