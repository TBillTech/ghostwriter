=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm implicit dialog beats (indirect, subtext) as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, but to do it indirectly!
Ask yourself, what points could be of great interest to the audience, and be inferred from the touch-point. Come up with creative ideas that are small pieces of the touch-point, but be cagey and don't just dump the idea on the reader.
For example, it may help to imagine that the audience might be offended by just coming out and saying it.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
The Wolf smiled. "Such a charming hood—it brightens these shadows."

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be artfully danced around:
Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Indirectly alluding to this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to suggest things to the readers mind, with the goal of making the touch point seem to emerge like an aha-moment. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.

=== RESPONSE ===
* The birds hush as red answers, and she mistakes it for listening.
* red clutches the basket tighter when wolf glances at it, then smiles so he will not think her rude.
* wolf repeats red’s word “Grandmother” as if tasting it, then asks how far “the little cottage” might be.
* A breeze lifts the red hood; wolf’s eyes follow its flutter more than the path.
* red says, “I should keep to the path,” and wolf replies, “Of course,” while stepping half a paw off it.
* The jam’s sweetness seems stronger when wolf draws near, covering a faint, damp fur smell.
* red brightens at “shortcut,” then remembers, “Mama said no,” and looks down as though she broke something already.
* wolf tilts his head toward a darker lane and calls it “quicker daylight.”
* A pine cone drops; red startles, and wolf chuckles like it was a shared joke.
* wolf praises the basket’s weight and offers to carry it, “only till the next bend,” a bend where the trees knit closer.
* red asks, “Do you know Grandmother?” and wolf says, “Not yet,” like it is a compliment.
* Their shadows touch before their hands do; wolf steps so his longer shade goes first.
* red hums a nursery tune that wavers when she notices her footprints have company.
* wolf counts her steps aloud by admiring her “steady pace,” and suggests she could be “steadier still” off the stones.
* A squirrel freezes on a trunk, eyes wide; red waves, wolf waves too, and the squirrel bolts into bramble.
* red repeats, “I mustn’t dawdle,” and wolf says, “Then don’t,” pointing the wrong way with an open, helpful paw.
* He asks if Grandmother keeps her door latched “against drafts,” and red answers about the little iron hook without seeing his smile tighten.
* The path dimples into shade; wolf calls it “cool relief,” and red rubs her arms though the air has not grown colder.
* red says “please” and “thank you” too often in a row, like pebbles tossed in a deep well.
* wolf remarks that “the woods are friendliest when quiet,” just as the last bird falls silent.
