* wolf repeats red’s word “Grandmother” as if tasting it, then asks how far “the little cottage” might be.
* red asks, “Do you know Grandmother?” and wolf says, “Not yet,” like it is a compliment.
* A pine cone drops; red startles, and wolf chuckles like it was a shared joke.
* He asks if Grandmother keeps her door latched “against drafts,” and red answers about the little iron hook without seeing his smile tighten.
* A squirrel freezes on a trunk, eyes wide; red waves, while wolf freezes too. Suddenly the squirrel bolts into bramble.
