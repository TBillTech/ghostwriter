The Wolf purred, "Grandmother, how far is the little cottage? I like to measure a path by whispers before I step forward."

Little Red blinked. "Do you know Grandmother?"

The Wolf chuckled. "Not far, little traveler; the cottage lies where the pines murmur, and I worry for your steps. Would you like me to show you a quicker way, one that keeps your footprints light and your good intentions intact? Only a suggestion, of course—your mother needn't know."

Little Red noted, "Yes, I know Grandmother. She is my grandmother, and I bring her these goodies to help her feel better. Please, I must hurry to her and stay on the path."

The Wolf froze. "A quicker path, is that what you seek? I know doors that yield to a whispered word and a latch that answers only to a careful touch. Every shortcut bears a price, and some doors stay latched unless you’re prepared to pay the toll."
