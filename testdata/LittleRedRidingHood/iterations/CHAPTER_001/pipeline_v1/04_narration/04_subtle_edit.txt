# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
Red walks the forest path, humming, basket in hand.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, the red hood bright against the pines, humming a small, steady tune that kept time in her chest. The basket hung from her arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing, seeming like both gift and responsibility as the scent of resin and bread threaded behind her. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; she moved from gold to shadow and back again while birds stirred in the boughs and fell silent whenever the wind tilted. A brief lift of air nudged the jam-sweet smell toward the bracken; damp earth clung to her shoes and pine needles softened every footfall. She passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on, the tune on her lips as steady as the trail.

Wolf paced unseen among the bracken, keeping parallel to her course, the forest swallowing claws and breath. The scents reached him faintly when the wind favored him, and he matched her stride—silently moving when she moved, pausing when she paused—like a shadow practicing another life.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace generic object/name mentions with factoid names where appropriate: call the basket the "Basket of Goodies" and her cloak the "Red Hood" at least once to align with the factoids.
- In paragraph 1, cut or tighten the line "seeming like both gift and responsibility" — instead explicitly link the Basket of Goodies to its origin (e.g., a gift from Grandmother) if you want that meaning, or remove the sentiment to avoid vagueness.
- Change pronouns to proper names for clarity and narration preference: replace "him" and "he" in paragraph 2 with "Wolf" (e.g., "the scents reached Wolf... and Wolf matched her stride").
- Remove or rework the metaphor "like a shadow practicing another life" — it is vague and distracts from the clear action of following; replace with a concrete description of Wolf's movements (e.g., "following her every step at the edge of the bracken").
- Trim redundancy in sentence endings (for example, "the tune on her lips as steady as the trail") — either shorten to "the tune on her lips" or rephrase to add new detail about her humming.
- Consider reducing overly lush sensory lines that slow pacing (e.g., "Shafts of pale light..." and "A brief lift of air nudged the jam-sweet smell...") by combining or simplifying so the core touch-point (Red walking, humming, basket in hand) stays central.
- Ensure no forbidden foreshadowing is made explicit — keep any hints vague and avoid naming future events or consequences.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.
