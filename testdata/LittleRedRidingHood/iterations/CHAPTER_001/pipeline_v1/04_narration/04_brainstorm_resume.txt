=== SYSTEM ===
You are brainstorming narrative beats as concise bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

ALWAYS keep to the facts. Anything that sounds like dialog we will leave for the dialog parts of the story.  We need to generate pure narrative pseudo-historical prose.

Her iconic red\nhood and basket are more than props—they’re little anchors of bravery when\nthe woods press close.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:


# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
Red walks the forest path, humming, basket in hand.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.
6. **Format**: Do NOT print any other information besides bullet points starting the line with '*' character.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to give the readers a picture of the environment and what is objectively happning, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real. Leave feelings and opinions for later. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution.

=== RESPONSE ===
* red steps along the winding dirt trail, the red hood bright against the pines
* red hums a small, steady tune that keeps her pace even
* the basket hangs from red’s arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing
* bread and jam ride in the basket, their sweet smell trailing behind red
* shafts of pale light cross the path; red passes from gold to shadow and back again
* birds stir in the boughs and hush when the wind changes
* damp earth clings to red’s shoes; pine needles soften her footfall
* red keeps to the center of the path where the ground is firmest
* the red hood shifts with a mild breeze and settles again on red’s shoulders
* the forest path bends ahead; the next turn hides the stretch beyond
* wolf paces unseen among the bracken, parallel to red’s course
* wolf measures red’s stride and the swing of the basket between trees
* the scent of jam reaches wolf faintly when the wind favors him
* a twig gives a dry snap off the path; red slows a fraction and then continues
* a jay flits low across the trail and vanishes into the underbrush
* a narrow deer track forks away, but red stays on the worn main way
* sun-warm dust rises under red’s steps and settles in her wake
* wolf keeps to shadowed trunks, placing paws where needles lie deepest
* the hood’s bright cloth marks red’s progress at a distance between trunks
* red adjusts the basket’s handle for comfort and resumes her steady hum
* the path climbs a little, then smooths, and the trees lean closer overhead
* a ribbon of cool air slides down the slope, lifting the edge of the cloak
* wolf notes the timing of the bends and the silent stretches without birds
* red passes a mossy stump, glances at a cluster of flowers, and moves on
* the smell of resin and bread mingles, thin as thread, along the path behind her
