* red steps along the winding dirt trail, the red hood bright against the pines
* red hums a small, steady tune that keeps her pace even
* the basket hangs from red’s arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing
* shafts of pale light cross the path; red passes from gold to shadow and back again
* birds stir in the boughs and hush when the wind changes
* damp earth clings to red’s shoes; pine needles soften her footfall
* red passes a mossy stump, glances at a cluster of flowers, and moves on
* the smell of resin and bread in the basket mingles, thin as thread, along the path behind her
* wolf paces unseen among the bracken, parallel to red’s course
* wolf copies Red’s stride, silently moving when Red moves, and pausing when Red pauses
* the scents reach wolf faintly when the wind favors him
