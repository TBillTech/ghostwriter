* red walks the winding dirt trail beneath tall pines, her bright red hood catching stray light between branches.
* The wicker basket rests on red's arm; inside are bread and jam, wrapped and steady beneath a shifting lid.
* A soft tune hums from red as she goes, even and unhurried along the path.
* Damp earth scents the air, threaded with the sweetness coming from the basket.
* Birds rustle in the canopy and fall still when the wind crosses the path.
* Shafts of light stripe the ground, sliding over red's cloak and the uneven trail.
* Pine needles and cones scatter underfoot; red chooses her steps around the rough patches.
* Glass taps within the basket, and the wicker gives a small creak with each swing.
* The red hood, given by Grandmother, shows plainly against the forest greens.
* The trail carries red toward Grandmother’s cottage deeper among the pines.
* At a bend, red’s humming thins as the forest quiets, then gathers again as she moves on.
* wolf keeps to the shadowed trees beside the path, pacing red’s progress with silent pauses.
* wolf lifts his muzzle to the breeze and takes in the smells of bread, jam, and child.
* Soft paw prints sink into moist soil where wolf passes, soon hidden by fallen needles.
* Low boughs press over the path; red ducks, and the tip of her hood brushes resin-sticky twigs.
* A small gust carries the sweet jam scent deeper into the woods; wolf turns along a deer track that meets the path ahead.
* red steadies the basket with a free hand as the trail dips, and the sweetness hangs stronger in the air.
* Light glints on a jar rim inside the basket when the hood shifts back.
* The forest holds quiet save for red’s humming and the faint brush of wolf moving through fern.
