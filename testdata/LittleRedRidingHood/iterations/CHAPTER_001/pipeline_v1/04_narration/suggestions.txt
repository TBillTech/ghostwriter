- Open with a sentence that explicitly matches the touch-point: replace the opening sentence with or lead into “Red walked the forest path, humming, basket in hand” (then follow with sensory detail).  
- Replace “rested on Red's arm” with “basket in hand” (or “held in her hand”) so the touch-point wording is reflected exactly.  
- Remove redundant mentions of “path”/“trail” (e.g., change “winding dirt path… trail” to a single clear noun) to tighten the first paragraph.  
- Recast “The red hood Grandmother had given Red” for concision and smoother flow—e.g., “Red’s red hood, a gift from Grandmother,” or “the red hood Grandmother had given her” (prefer “Red” when clarity is needed).  
- Avoid the phrase “took in the smells of bread, jam, and child” — replace “child” with “Red” to keep narration names-based and clear.  
- Reduce repetition of “sweetness/jam” smells: combine or vary references (one strong scent sentence rather than three similar ones).  
- Change passive phrasing around Wolf to active, name-based constructions (e.g., “Wolf lifted his muzzle to the breeze” instead of “lifted a muzzle”; “Wolf’s paws sank into the moist soil” instead of “Soft paw prints sank…”).  
- Simplify or tighten awkward clauses: “moving along a deer track that met the path ahead” → “following a deer track that met the path” or “following a deer track to the path.”  
- Replace mild clichés like “silent pauses” with a specific action or sensory detail (e.g., “pausing between steps” or “lingering in the shadow”) to make Wolf’s motion clearer.  
- Trim one or two descriptive lines that repeat texture/lighting (e.g., either “shafts of light striped the ground” or “catching stray beams between branches,” not both) to improve pacing and keep focus on Red’s hum and basket.
