Shafts of light striped the ground, sliding over Red's bright cloak and the uneven trail as Red walked the winding dirt path beneath the tall pines. The red hood Grandmother had given Red showed plainly against the forest greens, catching stray beams between branches. Birds rustled in the canopy and fell still when the wind crossed the path. Damp earth scented the air, threaded with the sweetness rising from the wicker basket that rested on Red's arm. Pine needles and cones scattered underfoot; Red chose her steps around the rough patches. Low boughs pressed over the path; Red ducked, and the tip of the hood brushed resin-sticky twigs.

A soft tune hummed from Red as she went, even and unhurried. At a bend the humming thinned as the forest quieted, then gathered again as Red moved on. Inside the basket, bread and jam lay wrapped and steady beneath a shifting lid; glass tapped against wicker and the basket gave a small creak with each swing. Light glinted on a jar rim when the hood shifted back. Red steadied the basket with a free hand as the trail dipped, and the sweetness hung stronger in the air. A small gust carried the jam scent deeper into the woods.

Wolf, moving along a deer track that met the path ahead, lifted a muzzle to the breeze and took in the smells of bread, jam, and child. He kept to the shadowed trees beside the path, pacing Red's progress with silent pauses. Soft paw prints sank into the moist soil where Wolf passed, soon hidden by fallen needles, and the forest held quiet save for Red's humming and the faint brush of Wolf moving through the fern as the trail carried Red toward Grandmother's cottage deeper among the pines.
