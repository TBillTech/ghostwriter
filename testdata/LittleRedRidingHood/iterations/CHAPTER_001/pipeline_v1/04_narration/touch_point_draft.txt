Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, the red hood bright against the pines, humming a small steady tune that kept time in her chest. The basket of goodies hung from her arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing—a gift for Grandmother, filled with bread and jam. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; birds stirred in the boughs and a lift of air nudged the jam-sweet smell toward the bracken. Damp earth clung to her shoes and pine needles softened every footfall. She passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on, the tune on her lips.

Wolf paced unseen among the bracken, keeping parallel to her course, the forest swallowing claws and breath. The scents reached Wolf faintly when the wind favored, and Wolf matched her stride—silently moving when she moved, pausing when she paused—following her every step at the edge of the bracken.
