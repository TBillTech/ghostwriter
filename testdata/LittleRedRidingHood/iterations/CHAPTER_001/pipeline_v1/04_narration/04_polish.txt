# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, the Red Hood bright against the pines, humming a small steady tune that kept pace in her chest. The basket hung from Red’s arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing, seeming like both gift and responsibility as the scent of resin and bread threaded behind her. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; Red moved from gold to shadow and back again while birds stirred in the boughs and fell silent whenever the wind tilted. A brief lift of wind nudged the jam-sweet smell toward the bracken; damp earth clung to Red’s shoes and pine needles softened every footfall. Red passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on, the tune on her lips as steady as the trail.

Wolf paced unseen among the bracken, keeping parallel to Red’s course, the forest swallowing claws and breath. The scents reached Wolf faintly when the wind favored him, and Wolf matched Red’s stride—silently moving when Red moved, pausing when Red paused—like a shadow practicing another life.

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.
