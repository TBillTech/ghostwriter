Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, the red hood bright against the pines, humming a small, steady tune that kept time in her chest. The basket hung from her arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing, seeming like both gift and responsibility as the scent of resin and bread threaded behind her. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; she moved from gold to shadow and back again while birds stirred in the boughs and fell silent whenever the wind tilted. A brief lift of air nudged the jam-sweet smell toward the bracken; damp earth clung to her shoes and pine needles softened every footfall. She passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on, the tune on her lips as steady as the trail.

Wolf paced unseen among the bracken, keeping parallel to her course, the forest swallowing claws and breath. The scents reached him faintly when the wind favored him, and he matched her stride—silently moving when she moved, pausing when she paused—like a shadow practicing another life.
