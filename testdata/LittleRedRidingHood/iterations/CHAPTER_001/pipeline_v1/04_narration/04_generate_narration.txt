Ordered bullets
===============
* red steps along the winding dirt trail, the red hood bright against the pines
* red hums a small, steady tune that keeps her pace even
* the basket hangs from red’s arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing
* the smell of resin and bread in the basket mingles, thin as thread, along the path behind her
* shafts of pale light cross the path; red passes from gold to shadow and back again
* birds stir in the boughs and hush when the wind changes
* a brief shift of wind lifts the jam-sweet scent and nudges it toward the bracken
* damp earth clings to red’s shoes; pine needles soften her footfall
* red passes a mossy stump, glances at a cluster of flowers, and moves on
* wolf paces unseen among the bracken, parallel to red’s course
* the scents reach wolf faintly when the wind favors him
* wolf copies Red’s stride, silently moving when Red moves, and pausing when Red pauses

Instructions
============
- Convert the ordered bullets into a continuous narrative paragraph or two.
- Keep it vivid, concise, and in the established voice.
- Do not include bullet markers or headings in your output.
- Return only the prose.
- DO NOT say "a symbol of", be sure to transform this into "seemed like" or just "like" or some other simile.
- Be sure to reformat spaces so that it looks natural.
- Strongly prefer using proper names over pronouns like "they", "him", "it".


=== RESPONSE ===
Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, the Red Hood bright against the pines, humming a small steady tune that kept pace in her chest. The basket hung from Red’s arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing, seeming like both gift and responsibility as the scent of resin and bread threaded behind her. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; Red moved from gold to shadow and back again while birds stirred in the boughs and fell silent whenever the wind tilted. A brief lift of wind nudged the jam-sweet smell toward the bracken; damp earth clung to Red’s shoes and pine needles softened every footfall. Red passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on, the tune on her lips as steady as the trail.

Wolf paced unseen among the bracken, keeping parallel to Red’s course, the forest swallowing claws and breath. The scents reached Wolf faintly when the wind favored him, and Wolf matched Red’s stride—silently moving when Red moved, pausing when Red paused—like a shadow practicing another life.
