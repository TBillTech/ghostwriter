=== SYSTEM ===
You will order and refine brainstormed bullet points for coherent flow.

=== USER ===
You are a director examining the output of a creative brainstorming session, also working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is simply to order the bullets in the most logial sequence possible. You are not allowed to take bullets away.
You are however, allowed to add new intermediate bullets to help the sequence make more sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:


# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide your results as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character.
2. **Clean Lines**: If there are intent words at the beginning of the given bullets, for example "Clarity - ", or "Flavor: " leave those out and just recover the point without a title.
3. **Just Bullets Output**: Strip off, ignore, and do not output any markdown or other formatting, other than just only '*' character at line start.

Now, Here are the Bullets to be ordered in as logical a way as possible:
* red walks the winding dirt trail beneath tall pines, her bright red hood catching stray light between branches.
* The wicker basket rests on red's arm; inside are bread and jam, wrapped and steady beneath a shifting lid.
* A soft tune hums from red as she goes, even and unhurried along the path.
* Damp earth scents the air, threaded with the sweetness coming from the basket.
* Birds rustle in the canopy and fall still when the wind crosses the path.
* Shafts of light stripe the ground, sliding over red's cloak and the uneven trail.
* Pine needles and cones scatter underfoot; red chooses her steps around the rough patches.
* Glass taps within the basket, and the wicker gives a small creak with each swing.
* The red hood, given by Grandmother, shows plainly against the forest greens.
* The trail carries red toward Grandmother’s cottage deeper among the pines.
* At a bend, red’s humming thins as the forest quiets, then gathers again as she moves on.
* wolf keeps to the shadowed trees beside the path, pacing red’s progress with silent pauses.
* wolf lifts his muzzle to the breeze and takes in the smells of bread, jam, and child.
* Soft paw prints sink into moist soil where wolf passes, soon hidden by fallen needles.
* Low boughs press over the path; red ducks, and the tip of her hood brushes resin-sticky twigs.
* A small gust carries the sweet jam scent deeper into the woods; wolf turns along a deer track that meets the path ahead.
* red steadies the basket with a free hand as the trail dips, and the sweetness hangs stronger in the air.
* Light glints on a jar rim inside the basket when the hood shifts back.
* The forest holds quiet save for red’s humming and the faint brush of wolf moving through fern.
