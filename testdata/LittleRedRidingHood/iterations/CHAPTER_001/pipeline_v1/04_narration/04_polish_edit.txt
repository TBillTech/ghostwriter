# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, the Red Hood bright against the pines, humming a small, steady tune that kept time in her chest. The Basket of Goodies hung from her arm, wicker creaking softly with each swing — a gift from Grandmother, filled with bread and jam. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; birds stirred in the boughs and a lift of air nudged the jam-sweet smell toward the bracken. Damp earth clung to her shoes and pine needles softened every footfall. She passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on, the tune on her lips.

Wolf paced unseen among the bracken, keeping parallel to her course, the forest swallowing claws and breath. The scents reached Wolf faintly when the wind favored Wolf, and Wolf matched her stride—silently moving when she moved, pausing when she paused—following her every step at the edge of the bracken.

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.
