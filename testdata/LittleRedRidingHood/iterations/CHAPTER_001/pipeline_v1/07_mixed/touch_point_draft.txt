Wolf smirks. "Soft and practiced, I offer warmth, not fear. The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace."

Red clutches the basket. "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet."

The wind shifts, carrying the scent of jam farther than her voice can reach. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight.

A branch slides across the wicker. Her fingers tighten until it creaks. The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late."

"Is there a quicker way? Would it be safe, please?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself.
