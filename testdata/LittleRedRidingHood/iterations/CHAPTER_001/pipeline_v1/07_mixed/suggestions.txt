1. Replace Wolf's opening line with a tighter, more Wolf-y phrasing that drops the clumsy "Soft and practiced" and the explicit offer of "warmth, not fear." Suggested rewrite: change the first sentence to something like, "Good morning, little traveler—there's a quicker way, if your courage keeps pace," with Wolf's cadence suggested by punctuation and a tucked-on adverb (softly, silkily). This keeps his oily charm and removes the awkward double-claim about warmth vs. fear.

2. Remove the redundant sentence about repeating "quicker" literally: delete "He lets the last word ripple, repeating 'quicker' with an extra sweetness." Instead, show it in a brief action beat (see #4).

3. Tighten Red's line about shadows: replace "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet." with a single, simpler line that sounds more like her voice—e.g., "The shadows feel strange; my eyes don't see well there." Keeps naivety and politesse while trimming wordiness.

4. Add a very short, physical Wolf beat to replace the removed repetition and to foreshadow menace subtly. Insert after his line: "He draws the final word out, sibilant and slow, a smile folding the forest quieter." Or: "He lingers on the last syllable, teeth bright behind his smile." This implies danger without stating intent.

5. Cut or condense the mildly purple sentence "The wind shifts, carrying the scent of jam farther than her voice can reach." Make it leaner and more immediate: "A wind lifts the jam's scent; it drifts ahead of her words." Keeps the sensory cue without overpainting.

6. Remove the slightly redundant pair "A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight." Keep either the jay or the weight image, not both. Suggested: keep "A jay cackles once and vanishes." Then follow with a shorter silence beat: "Then silence settles." This preserves rhythm and avoids simile overload.

7. Tighten the wicker/branch moment: replace "A branch slides across the wicker. Her fingers tighten until it creaks." with a single compact beat that shows her reaction: "A branch brushes the basket; her fingers clamp until it creaks." Fewer sentences, stronger motion.

8. Make the crooked stump image less passive—connect it to Red's motion. Replace "The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles." with "The crooked stump's shadow crosses her boots; she falters on loose needles." Keeps the atmospheric detail but reduces narrative wandering.

9. Combine Red's "Thank you..." and the tentative question that follows into clearer turns of dialog and character: after her "Grandmother is waiting..." have a brief beat (she glances at the path), then her question in one line that shows politeness and curiosity: "If there's a quicker way—would it be safe, please?" This keeps her literal politeness and shows the pull to stray without awkwardness.

10. Add one small narrative anchor after Red's question to restore balance between dialog and action: a single-line reaction from Wolf that is slightly flattering and sly (e.g., "Wolf's eyes sharpen; he inclines his head as if offering a confidential map"). This prevents dialog from floating and returns focus to danger.

11. Finally, watch repeated "quicker"/"quickest" wording across Wolf's lines. Use one variant per turn—either "quicker" or "quickest"—to avoid repetition and to make his offer feel deliberate, not sloppy.

12. Overall pruning: eliminate two to three of the more ornate images (pick from the jam-scent phrasing, the heavy-silence simile, or the crooked-stump shadow line) so the passage reads briskly and lets the lingering menace breathe rather than be crowded by description.
