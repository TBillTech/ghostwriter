- Remove or rewrite: "He lets the last word ripple, repeating 'quicker' with an extra sweetness." Replace with a brief Wolf mannerism that shows his cadence: e.g., let him draw out the sibilant and repeat Red's phrase softly ("Quicker, little one...") so the manipulation lives in voice, not in meta-description.

- Cut redundancy between "Red clutches the basket." and "Her fingers tighten until it creaks." Combine into one tighter beat that shows physical reaction and the basket's sound in one line (e.g., "Red clutches the basket; the wicker creaks under her fingers.").

- Soften the explicitness of threat/foreshadowing. Instead of any line that hints directly at Wolf's hunger, add a tiny, ambiguous physical detail after Wolf speaks (a lip lick, a low swallow, a scent of musk) to imply appetite without stating it.

- Make Wolf's opening line more in-character: add sly flattery and a trailing theatrical pause. Suggest replacing the first sentence with a version that elongates sibilants and repeats Red's words back to her: e.g., "The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees," he purred, "and I can guide you—if your courage keeps pace." Then follow with a whispered echo of "quicker" as a vocal beat rather than narration.

- Tweak Red's next line to stay in her earnest, literal voice and avoid phrasing that sounds adult/performative. Change "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet." to something simpler and more childlike: "The shadows feel odd. My eyes can't see well there yet."

- Replace "The wind shifts. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight." with a single lean sensory sentence: pick either the jay or the silence (not both). E.g., "A jay cackles once and goes; the forest hush that follows presses against the path." This trims imagery clutter.

- Remove or rework "The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles." Keep one concrete image: either the faltering step or the shadow. Suggest: "The crooked stump's shadow slides over her boots; she falters on loose needles." (Shorter, directional.)

- Change Red's hurried line "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late." to one that shows her politeness and conflict: "Thank you, but Grandmother waits— I mustn't keep her." Keeps cadence and implies internal tug.

- Adjust the question cluster ("Is there really a quicker way? Would it be safe?") into a single, character-driven question that shows naivety and politeness: e.g., "Is it... truly shorter? Is it safe?" or "A quicker way? Would that be safe, please?" This tightens dialog and preserves Red's cadence.

- Add a brief, silent beat after Wolf's invitation that shows Red's temptation: a glance at the dappled light off the path or an involuntary step toward the side, then her recovery. This gives visual cause for her falter and keeps momentum without long prose.

- Tighten final line: "Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself." Consider making it more immediate and less abstract: "Sunlight threads the pines; the path forks, and the woods hush around the choice." Keeps mood but reduces vagueness.

- Overall balance: trim one or two atmospheric sentences (suggested above) so dialog remains dominant. Where dialog pauses, insert single-line beats of action or sensory detail only—avoid paragraph-long descriptions that stall rhythm.
