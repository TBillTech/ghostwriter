=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You let your smile appear as a contrast, a flash between shadow and sunbeams—soft and practiced, never warming your eyes.

red: You admit, voice a little unsteady, "I don't think my eyes have adjusted to all these shadows. At moments, I feel disoriented!"

Narrator: The path narrows where the pines lean in; sunbeams break like thin glass on damp earth.

Narrator: The birds hush mid-rustle; the wind shifts, carrying the sweet scent of jam farther than her voice might.

wolf: You murmur, teeth just showing in a smile that doesn't warm, "Such a dutiful errand; your hood is a lantern in these woods."

red: You tug your hood snug and say, "Thank you. I mustn't dawdle. Grandmother is waiting."

Narrator: A shadow from a swaying branch slides across the basket; she tightens her fingers until the wicker creaks.

wolf: You flatter, honeyed and slow, "So brave, so obedient," letting the praise drip as you suggest, "Yet the pines press close—the light forgets to reach. Think how proud they'll be if you arrive sooner."

Narrator: He steps aside as if to clear the path, but his body angles toward the brambles, measuring her hesitation.

Narrator: A jay cackles once and is gone; the silence that follows is heavier than the basket.

Narrator: The crooked stump throws a long, fingerlike shadow across her boots; her next step falters on loose needles.

red: You ask, earnest and small, the word safe barely louder than a breath, "If there is a quicker way, would it be—safe?"

Narrator: Wolf’s smile widens by a whisker; the whites of his eyes catch a blade of sun, then vanish as a cloud slides over.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* You must deliver comfort and provisions; the errand gives your actions purpose.
* You care about Grandmother’s well-being and about keeping promises made to your family.
* You speak to steady yourself when the world feels uncertain; words are an anchor.
* You want reassurance that the route is safe; asking is a way to share and reduce fear.
* You aim to be polite and not offend a stranger, even while feeling uneasy.
* You hide a quick, practical fear beneath a brave, courteous tone—fear that the woods might conceal danger.
* Current mood: earnest, unsteady, attentive; brave enough to continue but unsettled by shadows.
* Your immediate goal in each line: admit disorientation to elicit guidance, affirm duty to forestall detainment, and solicit a clear answer about safety so you can choose whether to hurry or remain on the known path.

wolf:
* You seek to bend a choice without force; conversation is your method of persuasion.
* You want to guide her away from the safe, witnessed route toward solitude where your plans can proceed.
* You flatter and feign concern to lower her guard; compliments are tools to open a path.
* You conceal hunger and intent beneath theatrical courtesy; your true aim is obscured by charm.
* You avoid exposure to witnesses and prefer scenarios where timing and seclusion favor you.
* Current mood: smooth, patient, amused—pleasant on the surface with a sharpening hunger underneath.
* Your immediate goal in each line: present warmth as contrast to the woods’ chill, praise her to gain trust, suggest a quicker way as a pivot toward isolation, and position your body and words to measure her hesitation and readiness to stray.
