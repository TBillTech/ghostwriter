* Wolf's smile appears as a contrast, just like the shadows and the bright sun beams.
* "I don't think my eyes have adjusted to all these shadwos. At moments, I feel disoriented!"
* Narrator: The path narrows where the pines lean in; sunbeams break like thin glass on damp earth.
* Narrator: The birds hush mid-rustle; the wind shifts, carrying the sweet scent of jam farther than her voice might.
* "Such a dutiful errand," wolf murmurs, teeth just visible in a smile that doesn't warm his eyes. "Your hood is a lantern in these woods."
* "Thank you," red says, tugging the hood snug. "I mustn't dawdle. Grandmother is waiting."
* Narrator: A shadow from a swaying branch slides across the basket; she tightens her fingers until the wicker creaks.
* "So brave, so obedient," wolf says, flattery dripping like honey. "Yet the pines press close—the light forgets to reach. Think how proud they’ll be if you arrive sooner."
* Narrator: He steps aside as if to clear the path, but his body angles toward the brambles, measuring her hesitation.
* Narrator: A jay cackles once and is gone; the silence that follows is heavier than the basket.
* Narrator: The crooked stump throws a long, fingerlike shadow across her boots; her next step falters on loose needles.
* "If there is a quicker way, would it be—safe?" red asks, earnest and small, the word safe barely louder than a breath.
* Narrator: Wolf’s smile widens by a whisker; the whites of his eyes catch a blade of sun, then vanish as a cloud slides over.
