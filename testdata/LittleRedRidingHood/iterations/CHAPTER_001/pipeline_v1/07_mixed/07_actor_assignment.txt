=== SYSTEM ===
Assign lines to actors as 'id: line' entries (Narrator allowed for brief prose beats).

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* Wolf's smile appears as a contrast, just like the shadows and the bright sun beams.
* "I don't think my eyes have adjusted to all these shadwos. At moments, I feel disoriented!"
* Narrator: The path narrows where the pines lean in; sunbeams break like thin glass on damp earth.
* Narrator: The birds hush mid-rustle; the wind shifts, carrying the sweet scent of jam farther than her voice might.
* "Such a dutiful errand," wolf murmurs, teeth just visible in a smile that doesn't warm his eyes. "Your hood is a lantern in these woods."
* "Thank you," red says, tugging the hood snug. "I mustn't dawdle. Grandmother is waiting."
* Narrator: A shadow from a swaying branch slides across the basket; she tightens her fingers until the wicker creaks.
* "So brave, so obedient," wolf says, flattery dripping like honey. "Yet the pines press close—the light forgets to reach. Think how proud they’ll be if you arrive sooner."
* Narrator: He steps aside as if to clear the path, but his body angles toward the brambles, measuring her hesitation.
* Narrator: A jay cackles once and is gone; the silence that follows is heavier than the basket.
* Narrator: The crooked stump throws a long, fingerlike shadow across her boots; her next step falters on loose needles.
* "If there is a quicker way, would it be—safe?" red asks, earnest and small, the word safe barely louder than a breath.
* Narrator: Wolf’s smile widens by a whisker; the whites of his eyes catch a blade of sun, then vanish as a cloud slides over.


## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You let your smile appear as a contrast, a flash between shadow and sunbeams—soft and practiced, never warming your eyes.

red: You admit, voice a little unsteady, "I don't think my eyes have adjusted to all these shadows. At moments, I feel disoriented!"

Narrator: The path narrows where the pines lean in; sunbeams break like thin glass on damp earth.

Narrator: The birds hush mid-rustle; the wind shifts, carrying the sweet scent of jam farther than her voice might.

wolf: You murmur, teeth just showing in a smile that doesn't warm, "Such a dutiful errand; your hood is a lantern in these woods."

red: You tug your hood snug and say, "Thank you. I mustn't dawdle. Grandmother is waiting."

Narrator: A shadow from a swaying branch slides across the basket; she tightens her fingers until the wicker creaks.

wolf: You flatter, honeyed and slow, "So brave, so obedient," letting the praise drip as you suggest, "Yet the pines press close—the light forgets to reach. Think how proud they'll be if you arrive sooner."

Narrator: He steps aside as if to clear the path, but his body angles toward the brambles, measuring her hesitation.

Narrator: A jay cackles once and is gone; the silence that follows is heavier than the basket.

Narrator: The crooked stump throws a long, fingerlike shadow across her boots; her next step falters on loose needles.

red: You ask, earnest and small, the word safe barely louder than a breath, "If there is a quicker way, would it be—safe?"

Narrator: Wolf’s smile widens by a whisker; the whites of his eyes catch a blade of sun, then vanish as a cloud slides over.
