You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.

---

Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood and a basket in hand?" 

The forest quieted. 

"To my Grandmother's cottage." She hugged the basket closer.

"And what treasures have you tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" Wolf asked, voice as smooth as oil.
"Bread and jam — she is ill." 
 
"I'm sorry to hear that. How far is she from here, if you don't mind my asking?" 

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump — not far."

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
Wolf smirks. "The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace."

He lets the last word ripple, repeating "quicker" with an extra sweetness.

Red clutches the basket. "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet."

The wind shifts. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight.

A branch slides across the wicker. Her fingers tighten until it creaks. The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late."

"Is there really a quicker way? Would it be safe?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove or rewrite: "He lets the last word ripple, repeating 'quicker' with an extra sweetness." Replace with a brief Wolf mannerism that shows his cadence: e.g., let him draw out the sibilant and repeat Red's phrase softly ("Quicker, little one...") so the manipulation lives in voice, not in meta-description.

- Cut redundancy between "Red clutches the basket." and "Her fingers tighten until it creaks." Combine into one tighter beat that shows physical reaction and the basket's sound in one line (e.g., "Red clutches the basket; the wicker creaks under her fingers.").

- Soften the explicitness of threat/foreshadowing. Instead of any line that hints directly at Wolf's hunger, add a tiny, ambiguous physical detail after Wolf speaks (a lip lick, a low swallow, a scent of musk) to imply appetite without stating it.

- Make Wolf's opening line more in-character: add sly flattery and a trailing theatrical pause. Suggest replacing the first sentence with a version that elongates sibilants and repeats Red's words back to her: e.g., "The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees," he purred, "and I can guide you—if your courage keeps pace." Then follow with a whispered echo of "quicker" as a vocal beat rather than narration.

- Tweak Red's next line to stay in her earnest, literal voice and avoid phrasing that sounds adult/performative. Change "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet." to something simpler and more childlike: "The shadows feel odd. My eyes can't see well there yet."

- Replace "The wind shifts. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight." with a single lean sensory sentence: pick either the jay or the silence (not both). E.g., "A jay cackles once and goes; the forest hush that follows presses against the path." This trims imagery clutter.

- Remove or rework "The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles." Keep one concrete image: either the faltering step or the shadow. Suggest: "The crooked stump's shadow slides over her boots; she falters on loose needles." (Shorter, directional.)

- Change Red's hurried line "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late." to one that shows her politeness and conflict: "Thank you, but Grandmother waits— I mustn't keep her." Keeps cadence and implies internal tug.

- Adjust the question cluster ("Is there really a quicker way? Would it be safe?") into a single, character-driven question that shows naivety and politeness: e.g., "Is it... truly shorter? Is it safe?" or "A quicker way? Would that be safe, please?" This tightens dialog and preserves Red's cadence.

- Add a brief, silent beat after Wolf's invitation that shows Red's temptation: a glance at the dappled light off the path or an involuntary step toward the side, then her recovery. This gives visual cause for her falter and keeps momentum without long prose.

- Tighten final line: "Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself." Consider making it more immediate and less abstract: "Sunlight threads the pines; the path forks, and the woods hush around the choice." Keeps mood but reduces vagueness.

- Overall balance: trim one or two atmospheric sentences (suggested above) so dialog remains dominant. Where dialog pauses, insert single-line beats of action or sensory detail only—avoid paragraph-long descriptions that stall rhythm.
