1. Remove duplicated/near-duplicated Wolf lines. Keep one strong instance—prefer the sly, persuasive version ("The quickest way lies in the hush between trees...")—and delete the repeated smirk/murmur variants.

2. Delete the repeated bird/wind/jam scent sentences. Keep a single, vivid sensory line (e.g., "The wind shifts, carrying the scent of jam farther than her voice can reach.") and remove the second echo.

3. Tighten Red’s dialogue: change "These shadows feel strange; my eyes still haven't adjusted, and I feel a little unsteady.!" to a simpler, character-true line that sounds earnest and literal, e.g., "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet." Remove the stray exclamation/extra punctuation.

4. Remove the line that explicitly names the Wolf as "Soft and oily, the Wolf murmurs:" — it feels stagey and redundant after keeping one strong Wolf line. Let his cadence and word choice show the slyness.

5. Cut overwrought, repeated phrases about "hush between trees" and "quicker way" to one clear temptation from Wolf and one questioning response from Red. Repetition currently reads like self-echo; one compact exchange is stronger.

6. Replace "Red admitted, unsteady" and "Red tugged her hood snug" with brief action beats attached to her dialogue to avoid odd reporting-of-action phrasing. Example: Red clutches the basket. "To my Grandmother's cottage..." and later, Red tugs her hood. "Thank you... I mustn't be late."

7. Remove explicit physical-description lines that state feelings rather than show them: e.g., delete "Red's fingers tighten until the wicker creaks under the weight of her fear." Instead show the action plainly: "Her fingers tightened until the basket creaked." Leave the emotion implied.

8. Trim poetic sentences that obscure motion: pick either "Sunlight threads..." or "Light threads through the pines..." and keep the clearer one. Ensure the remaining one serves as a scene beat between dialogue.

9. Replace rhetorical/question clutter in Red's line "Is there a quicker way, and would it be safe??" with one crisp question true to her polite naivety: "Is there a quicker way? Would it be safe, please?" Remove double question marks.

10. Add one short narrative beat after Wolf tempts her to show his mannerism (soft sibilant, repeats her phrase) instead of telling it: e.g., "Wolf let the last word ripple, repeating 'quicker' with an extra sweetness." This keeps his voice theatrical without over-explaining.

11. Insert one grounding sensory detail before the choice moment (small, concrete—needle crunch, a beetle skittering, the smell of pine resin) so the reader feels the threshold without heavy exposition.

12. Remove the explicit foreshadowing "Wolf hasn't eaten in a while" if present; if you want hunger implied, let a single sly line (e.g., "Grandmother will be ever so grateful") or a tiny physical hint (a too-bright smile) imply appetite indirectly.

13. Normalize punctuation and remove ellipses/extra periods in dialogue endings. Use single clear sentence punctuation to keep cadence clean and the voice intact.

14. Preserve the writer's quirky, slightly lyrical voice but pare repetitive ornaments and let actions carry meaning—aim for alternating short dialogue lines and brief, concrete beats rather than multiple consecutive metaphors.
