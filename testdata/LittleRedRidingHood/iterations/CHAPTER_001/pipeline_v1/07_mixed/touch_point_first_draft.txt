Wolf smirked, "Soft and practiced, I offer warmth not fear; the fastest way lies in the hush between trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace.."
Red admitted, unsteady, "These shadows feel strange; my eyes still haven't adjusted, and I feel a little unsteady.!"
Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tightens, a quiet threshold where caution and curiosity push a traveler toward a hidden door.
Birds hush mid rustle, and the wind shifts, carrying the scent of jam farther than her voice can reach.
Wolf murmured, teeth showing, "Soft and practiced, the contrast is mine to keep; the quickest way lives in the hush between trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace.."
Red tugged her hood snug, "Thank you for your kindness; Grandmother is waiting, and I must not be late.."
A branch slides across the basket, and Red's fingers tighten until the wicker creaks under the weight of her fear.
Wolf purred, honeyed, "Soft and oily, the Wolf murmurs: thereâ€™s a quicker way, little one, if you trust the hush and slip along where no eyes linger.."
Birds hush mid rustle as the wind shifts, carrying the jam scent beyond her small voice.
A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight.
The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and Red's next step falters on the loose needles.
Red asked, earnest, "Is there a quicker way, and would it be safe??"
Light threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself.
