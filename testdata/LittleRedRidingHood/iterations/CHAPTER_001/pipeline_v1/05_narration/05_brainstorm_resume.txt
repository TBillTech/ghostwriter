=== SYSTEM ===
You are brainstorming narrative beats as concise bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

ALWAYS keep to the facts. Anything that sounds like dialog we will leave for the dialog parts of the story.  
We need to generate pure narrative pseudo-historical prose.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:


# Scene
Here is the scene the actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; this is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
Red walks the forest path, humming, basket in hand.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting each line with an '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown. Do NOT use nested bullets or dashes.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by their `id` field from the setting.
3. **Touch-Point**: Express this moment clearly and concretely; the key action should be visible to the reader (“on camera”), not merely implied.
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To" so that events and logic align with prior context.
5. **Scenes**: You should depict action directly when appropriate. Use sound, motion, rhythm, and consequence to convey the event.
6. **Tone**: Write in the manner of a classic fairytale, cinematic myth, or entertaining space opera — swift, sometimes symbolic, and dwell on implications instead of graphic detail. Focus on transformation, and atmosphere.
7. **Style**: Keep sentences concise and vivid. Each bullet should contribute one clear beat of story progression or imagery.
8. **Format**: Output only bullet points beginning with '*', with no headings or commentary.

Now, brainstorm creative ideas to give the readers a picture of the environment and what is objectively happening, with the goal of building upon and making the Touch-Point real. Leave feelings and opinions for later. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution (but do not make this explicit).
