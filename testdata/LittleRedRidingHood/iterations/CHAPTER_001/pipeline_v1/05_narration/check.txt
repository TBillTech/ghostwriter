You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
Red walks the forest path, humming, basket in hand.

# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Change tense to present throughout to match the touch-point: e.g., "Red walks the forest path, humming, a basket in her hand." Update all verbs (walked → walks, hummed → hums, moved → moves, lifted → lifts, stilled → stills, resumed → resumes, etc.).

- Strengthen subject names at sentence starts to avoid pronoun ambiguity: replace any sentence that begins with "She" or "He" where the previous sentence could confuse the referent (e.g., "When Red pauses, the Wolf stills; when Red moves, the Wolf resumes").

- Remove or rephrase the mildly suggestive hunger cue about the Wolf to avoid explicit foreshadowing: change "catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines" to a more neutral sensory note (e.g., "lifting his muzzle to the trail air and noting the drift of jam"). Avoid words implying appetite.

- Tighten repetitive wording and awkward modifiers: revise "watchful and patient in the watching forest" to a single clear phrase (e.g., "patient and watchful in the dim forest").

- Vary sentence rhythm by trimming one long sentence that piles metaphors: consider splitting "The wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam." into two short lines to preserve the writer's quirks but increase clarity (e.g., keep the simile but make it a punchy follow-up).

- Emphasize the touch-point action one more time toward the paragraph's start or end to anchor the scene: add a brief line like "Red hums a nursery tune as she keeps to the path" (present tense, simple diction in Little Red's voice).

- Keep concrete, simple details that fit Red's persona (flowers, creaking basket, polite cadence) but remove any line that risks sounding modern or out-of-era; ensure language remains fairy-tale simple and earnest.

- Small copy edits: change "black-barked tree" to "black-barked oak" or another specific tree type if you want concreteness, or drop the hyphen for smoother flow; change "pale dust rose and fell behind her" to "pale dust lifts behind her" to stay present-tense and tighter.
