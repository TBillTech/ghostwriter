Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over the Red Hood and the winding dirt trail. The Red Hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. Red stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker Basket hung on Red's arm, creaking with each swing and seeming like trust wrapped in bread and jam. The sweet scent of jam trailed behind Red like a ribbon. Pine needles hushed Red's footfalls; dust lifted and settled behind Red's heels. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as Red passed, and a light hum threaded from Redâ€™s lips, soft as a nursery tune.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. Wolf lifted the muzzle, tasting the trail-stirred air and the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, Wolf froze; when Red continued, Wolf moved again, each step measured, hungry and patient in the watching forest.
