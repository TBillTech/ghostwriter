=== SYSTEM ===
You will order and refine brainstormed bullet points for coherent flow.

=== USER ===
You are a director examining the output of a creative brainstorming session, also working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is simply to order the bullets in the most logial sequence possible. You are not allowed to take bullets away.
You are however, allowed to add new intermediate bullets to help the sequence make more sense.

Her iconic red\nhood and basket are more than props—they’re little anchors of bravery when\nthe woods press close.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:


# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide your results as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character.
2. **Clean Lines**: If there are intent words at the beginning of the given bullets, for example "Clarity - ", or "Flavor: " leave those out and just recover the point without a title.
3. **Just Bullets Output**: Strip off, ignore, and do not output any markdown or other formatting, other than just only '*' character at line start.

Now, Here are the Bullets to be ordered in as logical a way as possible:
* red steps along the winding dirt trail, her stride small and steady.
* The red_hood shows bright against the tall, shadowed pines.
* The basket of goodies hangs on her arm, wicker creaking with each swing.
* A light hum threads from red’s lips, soft as a nursery tune.
* Sunbeams fall in narrow bands, sliding over the red_hood and the path.
* The sweet scent of jam from the basket waft's behind red like a ribbon.
* Pine needles hush her footfalls; dust lifts and settles behind her heels.
* A tuft of blue flowers leans from the verge, nodding as she passes.
* wolf moves parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows.
* Wolf pauses when red pauses, and moves again when red continues.
* wolf lifts his muzzle, tasting the trail-stirred air and the sweetness of jam.
* The path bends around a black-barked pine, and the forest deepens a shade.
