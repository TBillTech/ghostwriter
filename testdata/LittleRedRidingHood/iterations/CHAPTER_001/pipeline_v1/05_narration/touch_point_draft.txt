Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.
