Ordered bullets
===============
* Sunbeams fall in narrow bands, sliding over the red_hood and the path.
* The red_hood shows bright against the tall, shadowed pines.
* The path bends around a black-barked pine, and the forest deepens a shade.
* red steps along the winding dirt trail, her stride small and steady.
* The basket of goodies hangs on her arm, wicker creaking with each swing.
* The sweet scent of jam from the basket waft's behind red like a ribbon.
* Pine needles hush her footfalls; dust lifts and settles behind her heels.
* A tuft of blue flowers leans from the verge, nodding as she passes.
* A light hum threads from red’s lips, soft as a nursery tune.
* wolf moves parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows.
* wolf lifts his muzzle, tasting the trail-stirred air and the sweetness of jam.
* Wolf pauses when red pauses, and moves again when red continues.

=== RESPONSE ===
Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over the Red Hood and the winding dirt trail. The Red Hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. Red stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker Basket hung on Red's arm, creaking with each swing and seeming like trust wrapped in bread and jam. The sweet scent of jam trailed behind Red like a ribbon. Pine needles hushed Red's footfalls; dust lifted and settled behind Red's heels. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as Red passed, and a light hum threaded from Red’s lips, soft as a nursery tune.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. Wolf lifted the muzzle, tasting the trail-stirred air and the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, Wolf froze; when Red continued, Wolf moved again, each step measured, hungry and patient in the watching forest.
