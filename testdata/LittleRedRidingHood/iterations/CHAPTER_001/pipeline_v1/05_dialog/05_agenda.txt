=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf greets Red and asks where she's going.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You step from the shade, voice smooth, paws quiet on the dirt.

wolf: You greet her with a soft, courteous tilt: "Good day, little one."

wolf: You ask, in that silky way that invites trust, "Where might you be going, little one?"

red: You lift the basket a little and say plainly, "I'm bringing goodies to Grandmother."

wolf: You murmur, as if savoring the thought, "Ah, bread and jam. Your basket smells very sweet."

red: You answer simply, "It's bread and jam. She is ill, so I must hurry."

wolf: You compliment the hood with a slow, flattering lilt: "What a fine red hood. It brightens this dark wood."

red: You touch your hood and tell him, "Grandmother made it for me."

wolf: You say, with a mild, curious smile, "She must love you dearly. Does she live far?"

red: You point toward the trees and reply, "Deeper in the pines, past the bend by the big stump."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* You care deeply about someone who is unwell and feel responsible to tend to them.
* You want to fulfill a promise and be seen as dutiful and kind.
* You are motivated to answer plainly and honestly because politeness and truthfulness are part of who you are.
* You seek reassurance that you are doing the right thing and that your haste is justified.
* You want brief approval or encouragement, not confrontation; praise calms your small anxieties.
* You are curious and easily distracted by kindness or flattery, which can pull you from rigid plans.
* You hide a quiet worry about doing something wrong and a wish for guidance rather than orders.
* Your mood is earnest, slightly rushed, and tender; you balance obedience with a gentle impulse to help.
* From the interaction you hope to leave unbothered and on your way, bolstered by a small kindness.

wolf:
* You are assessing opportunity through conversation; every word is a probe.
* You want information about routes and timing to shape future advantage.
* You aim to be accepted as a benign presence by leaning into charm and concern.
* You intend to redirect or influence choices while concealing true intent.
* You seek to create trust and lower vigilance so plans later can proceed unhindered.
* You hide hunger and predatory calculation beneath a veneer of civility and amusement.
* Your mood is amused, patient, and pleased—anticipatory rather than urgent.
* From the interaction you expect to gain precise details and emotional leverage to alter the child’s path.
