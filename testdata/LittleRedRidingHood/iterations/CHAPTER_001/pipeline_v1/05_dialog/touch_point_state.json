      "Well met, brave little traveler. Which way are you bound toward Grandmother’s house, and I’ll walk with you for a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me.",
      "Such courage shines in you, little one—your steps are guided by a moonlit thread. Which road toward Grandmother’s house are you bound for, and would you let a patient listener walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me?",
      "Bread and jam drift to me on the night air, sweet enough to loosen a wary heart. Which road toward Grandmother's house will you take, and may I walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me?",
      "That red hood brightens this dark wood, little traveler—such a soft glow that even shadows lean closer. Walk with me a stretch, and you may share a tiny secret; I’ll listen with patience and keep your pace steady.",
      "That warmth deserves a straight, unhurried path. Is Grandmother's house nearby, or must we walk a while to reach it?"

      "Further into the pines, beyond the bend by the big stump, is the path I must take. I’ll hurry straight to Grandmother now, and I’ll stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I must not waste any more time."
