- Remove duplicate Wolf greetings/questions. Keep one clear greeting that both compliments and asks destination once. Delete these three lines:
  - "Well met, brave little traveler. Which way are you bound toward Grandmother's house? I'll walk with you for a stretch if you share a tiny secret."
  - "Such courage shines in you, little one—your steps are guided by a moonlit thread. Which road are you bound for, and would you let a patient listener walk with you if you share a tiny secret?"
  - "That warmth deserves a straight, unhurried path," the Wolf added mildly. "Is Grandmother's house nearby, or must we walk a while to reach it?"

- Replace the remaining Wolf prose with one concise line that meets the touch-point and trims florid similes. Suggested replacement:
  - Wolf: "Child, your courage shines. Which road leads to your Grandmother's house? I'll walk with you a little if you'll share where you're going."

- Remove repeated offers to "walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret" from multiple Wolf lines; keep it only in the single consolidated Wolf line above.

- Eliminate repeated Red explanations and interior stage directions inside dialogue. Delete these redundant lines:
  - "Red lifted the basket. 'These goodies are for Grandmother. I'm going to her now, and thinking of how kind she is keeps me steady.'"
  - "Red replied simply, 'Thank you for noticing my care. It's bread and jam for Grandmother, and she is ill, so I must hurry.'"
  - "Red touched her hood. 'Grandmother made it for me. These goodies are for her, and I must hurry to her. Thank you for noticing my care; I'll go straight to Grandmother now.'"

- Replace Red's speech with one concise, direct reply that states purpose and urgency, without narrating actions or repeating gratitude. Suggested replacement:
  - Red: "They're for my Grandmother—bread and jam. She's ill, so I must hurry straight to her cottage."

- Move any stage directions out of spoken lines into brief action tags (kept separate from dialogue). For example:
  - Action tag before/after lines: Red steadies the basket; Wolf slips forward from the shade.
  - Do not include those tags as part of dialogue.

- Tone adjustments: remove overly metaphorical phrases about "moonlit thread" and "bread and jam drift to me on the night air." If the Wolf should be wistful, give one brief sensory line after the touch-point, but keep it short:
  - Optional Wolf follow-up (single line only): "The smell is tempting—such treats for an ill house make good company on the road." (Use only if needed.)

- Final ordering suggestion: Start with a brief action beat (Wolf emerges), Wolf's single greeting/question, Red's single concise answer, then an optional single Wolf sensory comment. This preserves the touch-point, reduces repetition, and keeps personalities intact.
