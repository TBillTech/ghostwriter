=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf greets Red and asks where she's going.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You step from the shade, voice smooth, paws quiet on the dirt.

wolf: You greet her with a soft, courteous tilt: "Good day, little one."

wolf: You ask, in that silky way that invites trust, "Where might you be going, little one?"

red: You lift the basket a little and say plainly, "I'm bringing goodies to Grandmother."

wolf: You murmur, as if savoring the thought, "Ah, bread and jam. Your basket smells very sweet."

red: You answer simply, "It's bread and jam. She is ill, so I must hurry."

wolf: You compliment the hood with a slow, flattering lilt: "What a fine red hood. It brightens this dark wood."

red: You touch your hood and tell him, "Grandmother made it for me."

wolf: You say, with a mild, curious smile, "She must love you dearly. Does she live far?"

red: You point toward the trees and reply, "Deeper in the pines, past the bend by the big stump."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
wolf: You smooth your voice and relish the courteous tilt you offered, expecting her curiosity to lean your way.
wolf: You feel the silky question hang in the air and savor the pause, already weighing which bait will lure answer or confession.
red: You clutch the basket a fraction tighter and answer plainly, steadying yourself with the thought of Grandmother.
wolf: You let her confirmation settle like a scent, nostrils faintly flaring as you imagine the bread and jam and what that detail might buy you.
red: You feel the compliment ripple warmth and worry both—grateful she notices, yet anxious to hurry to the sick bedside.
wolf: You spot the flicker of haste and use it, praising the hood to slow her steps and wrap her in flattery like a gentle net.
red: You touch the hood, half proud, half shy, and say simply that Grandmother made it, as if the fact should close the conversation.
wolf: You tilt your head, feigning mild curiosity at the name, already picturing the house and measuring distance in opportunity.
red: You point toward the trees and speak plainly, firm about the way and eager to be on it, anxious not to waste any more time.
