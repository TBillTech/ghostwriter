Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The Wolf greets Red and asks where she's going.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The Wolf bowed. "Where are you headed, little one? The woods hide many twists, and I know a quicker, kinder path—if you’d trust a patient guide to show you."

Red clutched her basket. "I’m headed to Grandmother’s with bread and jam for her. I will stay on the path and be careful as I go. Thank you for listening; I’ll hurry and do right by Grandmother."

The Wolf eyed her. "That destination sits plain as bread and jam, easy to weigh against a plan. The basket whispers of a shortcut you might be tempted to take. Is she far along this path?"

Red nodded. "Yes, the path goes on toward Grandmother’s cottage beyond the tall pines, and I won’t dawdle. I’ll stay on the safe path and hurry so I can bring bread and jam to her. Thank you for listening; I’ll do right by Grandmother."

The Wolf smiled. "Such a charming hood—it brightens even these shadows. If you’re tempted by a basket’s shortcut, I can show you a quicker, kinder route. Tell me where you’re headed. Is she far along this path, or does the next turn keep her waiting in the dusk?"

Red dipped her head. "Thank you kindly. Grandmother herself gave me this to bring to her, and I will hurry along the path."

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove the repeated assurances from Red. Delete one of these blocks: either Red's second speech ("Yes, the path goes on toward Grandmother’s cottage..." through "...bring bread and jam to her. Thank you for listening; I’ll do right by Grandmother.") or her final short line ("Thank you kindly..."), and keep a single clear, concise reply.

- Collapse redundant Wolf offers. Combine the two similar Wolf lines that offer a shortcut into one single, clearer line. Replace both with one line that both greets and offers the alternate route (see suggested wording below).

- Avoid literal or awkward metaphors: replace "The basket whispers of a shortcut you might be tempted to take" with a less anthropomorphic, subtler hint (suggested: "That basket marks a tempting errand; there are quicker paths if you’re curious.").

- Remove repetitive phrasing about destination and items. Red should state purpose once, plainly. Suggested compact Red reply: "I’m taking these bread and jam to my Grandmother's cottage. I’ll stick to the path and hurry."

- Tighten greetings to satisfy touch-point succinctly. Make Wolf's opening both a greeting and a clear question: Suggested Wolf opening line: "Good day, little one. Where are you headed? The woods are full of ways—perhaps I know a quicker, kinder route."

- Vary compliments and avoid repeating the same admiration. Keep either "Such a charming hood" or another short phrase, but don’t repeat similar praise twice. If keeping it, place it after Red's answer as a single line.

- Remove meta or stage-direction feel from speech. Change lines that sound like narration inside dialogue (none egregious, but watch for lines like "That destination sits plain as bread and jam" — replace with direct phrasing).

- Ensure each actor speaks distinctly:
  - Wolf: concise greeting + question + single offer of an alternate route.
  - Red: one clear statement of destination and promise to stay on the path; one brief polite acknowledgment if needed.

- Final suggested minimal exchange (replace current scattered lines):
  - Wolf: "Good day, little one. Where are you headed? The woods hide many turns—if you’d trust a patient guide, I can show a quicker, kinder path."
  - Red: "To my Grandmother’s cottage—bread and jam for her. I’ll stay on the path and hurry. Thank you."

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.
