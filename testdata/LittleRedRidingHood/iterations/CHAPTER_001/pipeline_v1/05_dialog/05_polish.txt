# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf bowed, "Where are you headed, little one? The woods hide many twists, and I know a quicker, kinder path—if you’d trust a patient guide to show you.?"
Red clutched, "I’m headed to Grandmother’s with bread and jam for her. 
I will stay on the path and be careful as I go. 
Thank you for listening; I’ll hurry and do right by Grandmother.."
The Wolf eyed, "That destination sits plain as bread and jam, easy to weigh against a plan. The basket whispers of a shortcut you might be tempted to take. Is she far along this path??"
Red nodded, "Yes, the path goes on toward Grandmother’s cottage beyond the tall pines, and I won’t dawdle. I’ll stay on the safe path and hurry so I can bring bread and jam to her. Thank you for listening; I’ll do right by Grandmother.."
The Wolf smiled, "Such a charming hood—it brightens even these shadows. If you’re headed for that basket’s shortcut, I can show you a quicker, kinder route—tell me where you’re headed. Is she far along this path, or does the next turn keep her waiting in the dusk?."
Red dipped, "Thank you kindly. Grandmother herself gave me this to bring to her, and I will hurry along the path.."

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.

The Wolf bowed. "Where are you headed, little one? The woods hide many twists, and I know a quicker, kinder path—if you’d trust a patient guide to show you."

Red clutched her basket. "I’m headed to Grandmother’s with bread and jam for her. I will stay on the path and be careful as I go. Thank you for listening; I’ll hurry and do right by Grandmother."

The Wolf eyed her. "That destination sits plain as bread and jam, easy to weigh against a plan. The basket whispers of a shortcut you might be tempted to take. Is she far along this path?"

Red nodded. "Yes, the path goes on toward Grandmother’s cottage beyond the tall pines, and I won’t dawdle. I’ll stay on the safe path and hurry so I can bring bread and jam to her. Thank you for listening; I’ll do right by Grandmother."

The Wolf smiled. "Such a charming hood—it brightens even these shadows. If you’re tempted by a basket’s shortcut, I can show you a quicker, kinder route. Tell me where you’re headed. Is she far along this path, or does the next turn keep her waiting in the dusk?"

Red dipped her head. "Thank you kindly. Grandmother herself gave me this to bring to her, and I will hurry along the path."
