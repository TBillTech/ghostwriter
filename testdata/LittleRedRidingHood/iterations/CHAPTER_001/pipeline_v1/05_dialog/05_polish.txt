# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf slipped forward, "From the shade I speak, child—your courage shines as bright as the moon. Which road toward grandmother’s house do you mean to take, and I’ll walk with you a stretch, if you share a tiny secret with me.."
The Wolf tilted courteously, "Well met, brave little traveler. Which way are you bound toward Grandmother’s house, and I’ll walk with you for a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me.."
The Wolf purred, "Such courage shines in you, little one—your steps are guided by a moonlit thread. Which road toward Grandmother’s house are you bound for, and would you let a patient listener walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me??"
Red lifted the basket, "These goodies are for Grandmother. I’m going to her now, and thinking of how kind she is keeps me steady.."
The Wolf murmured, "Bread and jam drift to me on the night air, sweet enough to loosen a wary heart. Which road toward Grandmother's house will you take, and may I walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me?."
Red replied simply, "Thank you for noticing my care. It’s bread and jam for Grandmother, and she is ill, so I must hurry.."
The Wolf complimented slowly, "That red hood brightens this dark wood, little traveler—such a soft glow that even shadows lean closer. Walk with me a stretch, and you may share a tiny secret; I’ll listen with patience and keep your pace steady.."
Red touched her hood, "Grandmother made it for me. These goodies are for Grandmother, and I must hurry to her. Thank you for noticing my care; I’ll go straight to Grandmother now.."
The Wolf smiled mildly, "That warmth deserves a straight, unhurried path. Is Grandmother's house nearby, or must we walk a while to reach it??"
Further into the pines, beyond the bend by the big stump, is the path I must take. I’ll hurry straight to Grandmother now, and I’ll stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I must not waste any more time.

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.

"Further into the pines, beyond the bend by the big stump, is the path I must take," Red said, steadying the basket. "I'll hurry straight to Grandmother now, and I'll stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I must not waste any more time."
