The Wolf bowed. "Where are you headed, little one? The woods hide many twists, and I know a quicker, kinder path—if you’d trust a patient guide to show you."

Red clutched her basket. "I’m headed to Grandmother’s with bread and jam for her. I will stay on the path and be careful as I go. Thank you for listening; I’ll hurry and do right by Grandmother."

The Wolf eyed her. "That destination sits plain as bread and jam, easy to weigh against a plan. The basket whispers of a shortcut you might be tempted to take. Is she far along this path?"

Red nodded. "Yes, the path goes on toward Grandmother’s cottage beyond the tall pines, and I won’t dawdle. I’ll stay on the safe path and hurry so I can bring bread and jam to her. Thank you for listening; I’ll do right by Grandmother."

The Wolf smiled. "Such a charming hood—it brightens even these shadows. If you’re tempted by a basket’s shortcut, I can show you a quicker, kinder route. Tell me where you’re headed. Is she far along this path, or does the next turn keep her waiting in the dusk?"

Red dipped her head. "Thank you kindly. Grandmother herself gave me this to bring to her, and I will hurry along the path."
