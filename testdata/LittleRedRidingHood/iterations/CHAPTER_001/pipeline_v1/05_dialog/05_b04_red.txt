DO NOT verbalise _ANYTHING_ above this line!  
The last 8 lines of dialog are:

The director now expects you to say something that matches your character.  You should definitely segue a response to the last N lines of dialog and consider responding according to your reaction.  The director gives you this prompt:
Reaction: You clutch the basket a fraction tighter and answer plainly, steadying yourself with the thought of Grandmother.
Line intent: You lift the basket a little and say plainly, "I'm bringing goodies to Grandmother."

Do not just repeat back the director's words, even if he tries to put words in your mouth.
DO NOT describe your own body language, that is weird. Keep your response to three sentences or less.
DO respond to the prior dialog, if there was any.
DO NOT repeat yourself.
Now, say more or less the same thing in your own words and voice. 

=== RESPONSE ===
These goodies are for Grandmother. I’m going to her now, and thinking of how kind she is keeps me steady.
