The Wolf bowed. "Good day, little one. Where are you headed? That basket marks a tempting errand; the woods are full of ways—if you’d trust a patient guide, I can show a quicker, kinder route."

Red clutched her basket. "To my grandmother’s cottage—bread and jam for her. I’ll stay on the path and hurry. Thank you."

The Wolf smiled. "Such a charming hood—it brightens these shadows."
