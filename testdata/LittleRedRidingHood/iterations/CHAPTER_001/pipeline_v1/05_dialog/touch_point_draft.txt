The Wolf slipped forward from the shade. "Child, your courage shines as bright as the moon. Which road toward Grandmother's house do you mean to take? I'll walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me."

Red lifted the basket. "These goodies are for Grandmother. I'm going to her now, and thinking of how kind she is keeps me steady."

The Wolf tilted his head courteously. "Well met, brave little traveler. Which way are you bound toward Grandmother's house? I'll walk with you for a stretch if you share a tiny secret."

Red replied simply, "Thank you for noticing my care. It's bread and jam for Grandmother, and she is ill, so I must hurry."

The Wolf purred, "Such courage shines in you, little one—your steps are guided by a moonlit thread. Which road are you bound for, and would you let a patient listener walk with you if you share a tiny secret?"

Red touched her hood. "Grandmother made it for me. These goodies are for her, and I must hurry to her. Thank you for noticing my care; I'll go straight to Grandmother now."

The Wolf murmured, "Bread and jam drift to me on the night air, sweet enough to loosen a wary heart. That red hood brightens this dark wood—such a soft glow that even shadows lean closer. Walk with me a stretch, and you may share a tiny secret; I'll listen with patience and keep your pace steady."

"That warmth deserves a straight, unhurried path," the Wolf added mildly. "Is Grandmother's house nearby, or must we walk a while to reach it?"

"Further into the pines, beyond the bend by the big stump, is the path I must take," Red said, steadying the basket. "I'll hurry straight to Grandmother now, and I'll stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I must not waste any more time."
