=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf greets Red and asks where she's going.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You slip from the bramble’s edge and purr, "Good morning, little traveler."

Narrator: You watch the birds hush as his smooth voice slides into the path’s quiet.

wolf: You tilt your head and ask, "Where might you be going, little one?"

red: You hug your basket and answer, "To my Grandmother’s cottage."

wolf: You let your gaze fall to the wicker and murmur, "And what have you there?"

red: You say, "Bread and jam, to make her strong. She is ailing."

wolf: You nod solemnly and ask, "How dutiful. Is the cottage far from here?"

red: You point ahead and tell him, "Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* You care because the errand to a loved elder anchors your day and gives your choices weight.
* You speak from a sense of duty and tender worry; the task feels both simple and important.
* You want to reassure yourself and others that you are keeping promises and doing right.
* You hope to be seen as helpful and disciplined, to honor guidance you were given.
* You fear causing further harm to the person you love and want to shorten that worry.
* You hide a naive optimism about danger; you downplay fear to stay brave-looking.
* Your current mood is earnest with an undercurrent of gentle anxiety; you steady yourself by stating facts.
* You aim to close the exchange quickly so you can reach safety, yet remain open to polite diversion.

wolf:
* You engage because the encounter is an opportunity to influence a vulnerable choice.
* You speak with feigned concern that masks strategic calculation; every question narrows the child’s options.
* You want to redirect the course of events toward solitude and convenience for your designs.
* You derive advantage from flattering trust and planting suggestions that seem harmless.
* You avoid revealing true hunger and intent; manipulation must appear as kindness.
* Your current mood is composed and eager, enjoying the slow unfolding of possibility.
* You aim to tilt the child’s path without force, to make obedience to your suggestion feel like help.
