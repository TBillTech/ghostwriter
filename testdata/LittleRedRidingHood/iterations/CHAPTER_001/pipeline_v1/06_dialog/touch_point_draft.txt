Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood and a basket in hand?" 

The forest quieted. 

"To my Grandmother's cottage, please." She hugged the basket closer. "Bread and jam — she is ill." 

"And what treasures have you tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" Wolf asked, voice as smooth as oil. "How far is she from here, if you don't mind my asking?" 

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump — not far."
