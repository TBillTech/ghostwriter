=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm dialog beats as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
The Wolf greets Red and asks where she's going.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative lines to give the readers clarity and flavor, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution (but do not make this explicit).
