ITEM 2: id=Narrator
=== SYSTEM ===
You write third-person narrative prose without quotation marks.
=== USER ===
You are writing third-person narrative prose that bridges or frames the surrounding dialog.

Rules:
- Do not use quotation marks.
- Keep the voice consistent with the current chapter’s style and scene.
- Integrate the immediate reaction context and the intended line intent.
- Be concise but evocative. Just a sentence or two. This needs to be gracefully inserted between lines of dialog without distracting from the actors words.
- Avoid actor attributions; this is narration, not a spoken line.

Context (may be partial and pre-formatted):

{'factoids': ['Basket of Goodies', 'Red Hood'], 'actors': ['Red', 'Wolf']}

{
  "Factoids": [
    {
      "name": "Basket of Goodies",
      "description": "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam."
    },
    {
      "name": "Red Hood",
      "description": "A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother."
    }
  ]
}

Active actors: Red, Wolf
Scene: {'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

Recent dialog context (tail):
{
  "Red": [],
  "Wolf": []
}

Agenda notes (may be empty):


Immediate cues:
- Line intent: You watch the birds hush as his smooth voice slides into the path’s quiet.
- Reaction to previous line: You watch the birds hush, the woodland lending weight to that smooth, purring greeting.

You are aware of or deeply care about the following details.
* You care because the errand to a loved elder anchors your day and gives your choices weight.
* You speak from a sense of duty and tender worry; the task feels both simple and important.
* You want to reassure yourself and others that you are keeping promises and doing right.
* You hope to be seen as helpful and disciplined, to honor guidance you were given.
* You fear causing further harm to the person you love and want to shorten that worry.

* Your current mood is earnest with an undercurrent of gentle anxiety; you steady yourself by stating facts.

* Red pointed ahead, "Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump."
The last 8 lines of dialog are:

DO NOT verbalise _ANYTHING_ above this line!  
The director now expects you to say something that matches your character.  You should definitely segue a response to the last N lines of dialog and consider responding according to your reaction.  The director gives you this prompt:
Reaction: You point ahead and answer plainly, eager to be helpful yet careful to keep the path in mind.
Line intent: You point ahead and tell him, "Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump."

Do not just repeat back the director's words, even if he tries to put words in your mouth.
DO NOT describe your own body language, that is weird. Keep your response to three sentences or less.
DO respond to the prior dialog, if there was any.
DO NOT repeat yourself.
Now, say more or less the same thing in your own words and voice. 


=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: Good morning, little traveler; the woods hush for a polite seeker.
Narrator: Birds hush as his smooth voice slides into the path's quiet, and the basket at Red's arm glints like a promise in the dim light.
wolf: And what have you there, little one, a wicker basket with secrets inside?
red: To my Grandmother’s cottage.
wolf: And what have you there, child, a wicker basket perhaps carrying more than bread?
red: Bread and jam, to make her strong. She is ailing.
wolf: How far to the cottage from here, child?
red: Beyond the three tall pines and the crooked stump lies the path ahead.
