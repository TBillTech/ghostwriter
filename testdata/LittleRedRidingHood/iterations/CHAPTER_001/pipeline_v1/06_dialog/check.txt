You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

One thing to watch out for is that these actors have tendency to repeat themselves.  If you notice this, point out where some text is redundant and should be removed. The audience won't like hearing the same thing over and over. 

Also watch out for the wrong balance of Narration. A few sentences where needed are OK to paint the picture, but this should be dialog not long prose.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should at some point directly address the following touch-point:


# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood and a basket in hand?" 

The forest quieted. 

"To my Grandmother's cottage." She hugged the basket closer.

"And what treasures have you tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" Wolf asked, voice as smooth as oil.
"Bread and jam — she is ill." 
 
"I'm sorry to hear that. How far is she from here, if you don't mind my asking?" 

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump — not far."

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove or replace "The forest quieted." — it's a blunt narration beat. Instead add a short, evocative line that belongs to scene-setting or to an actor (e.g., have Wolf's next line pick up the hush: "The forest seemed to lean closer," or "The pines listened,"), but keep it minimal.

- Trim Wolf's first question to avoid clumsy doubling ("bright hood" + "basket in hand"). Suggested rewrite: Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood?" or "— and that basket?" (choose one).

- Replace the simile "voice as smooth as oil" with something less literal and more in-voice for Wolf (e.g., "his voice low and oily" or "he said, all slipper and smile"). Keep the sly menace, but avoid heavy literal similes.

- Make Red's reply more character-specific and concise. Replace "To my Grandmother's cottage." / "She hugged the basket closer." with a single short line plus a brief, natural action: Red: "To my grandmother's cottage." (then a stage direction: Red clutched the basket.) Avoid a character narrating their own motion.

- Tighten the exchange about the basket's contents. Combine into one natural line for Red: instead of separate lines, use: Red: "Bread and jam—Grandmother's ill." (Keeps her plainness and politeness.)

- Shorten Wolf's follow-up question to remove filler "if you don't mind my asking?" Keep his tone coaxing but economical: Wolf: "How far is she from here?" or Wolf: "How far is that cottage?" Consider adding a sly echo of Red's phrasing to show manipulation: Wolf: "Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump, you say? Not far, then."

- Remove redundancy between "And what treasures..." and "what tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" They repeat the same idea. Replace the first with a single, characterful solicitation: Wolf: "And what have you tucked inside that pretty basket for a sick grandmother?" or simply Wolf: "What treats march in that basket?"

- Add a brief Wolf line that mirrors Red's phrasing (repetition as manipulation), but avoid implying hunger or predation. Example: after Red names the landmarks, Wolf repeats them softly: Wolf: "Three tall pines... the crooked stump. Not far at all." Keeps his mimicry without foreshadowing he's hungry.

- Ensure all narration remains sparse and belongs to scene-setting, not exposition. Any remaining stage directions should be one short clause (e.g., "Red clutched the basket," "The wolf's tail flicked once") and placed between dialogue lines rather than as separate paragraphs.

- Check tone consistency: make sure Red's lines stay simple and polite (please/thank you if present); Wolf's lines should slip compliments and mimicry subtly rather than outright flattery in every line. Remove any overly florid phrases that clash with the fairy-tale cadence.
