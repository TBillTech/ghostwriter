The Wolf inclined forward, "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam.

Little Red hesitated, "Is that shortcut safe? Will it still lead to Grandmother's?"

The hoofprints were small and neat.

The Wolf said, "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time."

Little Red said, "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step."

Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers.

Little Red said, "Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—goodbye, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting."

The Wolf bowed, "Happy trails—until we meet again."
