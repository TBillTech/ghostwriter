=== SYSTEM ===
You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

One thing to watch out for is that these actors have tendency to repeat themselves.  If you notice this, point out where some text is redundant and should be removed. The audience won't like hearing the same thing over and over. 

Also watch out for the wrong balance of Narration. A few sentences where needed are OK to paint the picture, but this should be dialog not long prose.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.

---

Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood and a basket in hand?" 

The forest quieted. 

"To my Grandmother's cottage, please." She hugged the basket closer. "Bread and jam — she is ill." 

"And what treasures have you tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" Wolf asked, voice as smooth as oil. "How far is she from here, if you don't mind my asking?" 

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump — not far."

---

Wolf smirks. "Soft and practiced, I offer warmth, not fear. The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace."

He lets the last word ripple, repeating "quicker" with an extra sweetness.

Red clutches the basket. "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet."

The wind shifts, carrying the scent of jam farther than her voice can reach. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight.

A branch slides across the wicker. Her fingers tighten until it creaks. The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late."

"Is there a quicker way? Would it be safe, please?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should at some point directly address the following touch-point:
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
The Wolf inclined forward, "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam.

Little Red hesitated, "Is that shortcut safe? Will it still lead to Grandmother's?"

The hoofprints were small and neat.

The Wolf said, "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time."

Little Red said, "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step."

Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers.

Little Red said, "Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—goodbye, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting."

The Wolf bowed, "Happy trails—until we meet again."

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Delete "Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam." It reads like awkward narration and interrupts the exchange; show Red clutching the basket instead if needed.
- Remove "The hoofprints were small and neat." It's unnecessary detail and breaks pacing; if you want a sensory beat, replace with a short action tied to Red ("She glanced at the narrow ruts, then back to the Wolf.") to keep it scene-focused.
- Trim the repeated stage directions for Little Red. Replace "Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers." with a brief, characterful action + line that preserves her voice, e.g.: Red tugs her hood tighter. "All right. I’ll take the deer track—thank you, but I must go."
- Soften or tighten the Wolf's simile "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step." Consider either keeping a shorter compliment in his oily cadence ("Bright memory. It will find the birch for you.") or keep the existing line but remove extra adjectives to avoid purple prose.
- Combine and simplify Red’s farewell to reduce repetition: change "Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—goodbye, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting." to "I'll take the deer track. Thank you. Grandmother's waiting." Keeps politeness and hurry without stilted repetition.
- Keep the shortcut touch-point explicit and decisive: ensure the line where Red accepts the shortcut is a spoken decision (see suggested replacement above) rather than purely narration.
- Optional: add a tiny hesitation beat in Red's dialogue (a short comma or pause) before she agrees, to show her naivety and thought process without long narration (e.g., "Is it—will it still lead to Grandmother's?" … "All right. I'll take it.").
- Verify no mention of the Wolf's hunger or other forbidden foreshadowing appears elsewhere in the scene.
