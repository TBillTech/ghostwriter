=== SYSTEM ===
You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

One thing to watch out for is that these actors have tendency to repeat themselves.  If you notice this, point out where some text is redundant and should be removed. The audience won't like hearing the same thing over and over. 

Also watch out for the wrong balance of Narration. A few sentences where needed are OK to paint the picture, but this should be dialog not long prose.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.

---

Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood and a basket in hand?" 

The forest quieted. 

"To my Grandmother's cottage." She hugged the basket closer.

"And what treasures have you tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" Wolf asked, voice as smooth as oil.
"Bread and jam — she is ill." 
 
"I'm sorry to hear that. How far is she from here, if you don't mind my asking?" 

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump — not far."

---

Wolf smirks. "The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace."

He lets the last word ripple, repeating "quicker" with an extra sweetness.

Red clutches the basket. "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet."

The wind shifts. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight.

A branch slides across the wicker. Her fingers tighten until it creaks. The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late."

"Is there really a quicker way? Would it be safe?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should at some point directly address the following touch-point:
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
The Wolf inclined forward, "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam.

Little Red hesitated, "Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?"

The Wolf said, "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time."

Little Red said, "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step."

Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers.

Little Red said, "Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—farewell, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting."

The Wolf bowed, "Happy trails—until we meet again."

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove the sentence "Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam." It reads oddly and personifies the basket in a way that distracts. Replace with a small physical beat showing Red's attachment to the basket (e.g., "She hugged the basket closer" or "The basket creaked against her arm").

- Replace repeated "Little Red said" tags with action beats to vary rhythm and keep voice: use tags like "Red hesitated," "Red tightened her hood," "Red said softly," or simply a beat before the line. Example changes:
  - Change "Little Red hesitated, 'Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?'" → "Red hesitated. 'Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?'"
  - Change "Little Red said, 'I remember the birch.'" → "Red nodded. 'I remember the birch.'"
  - Change "Little Red said, 'Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—farewell, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting.'" → "Red clutched the basket. 'I'll take the deer-track. Thank you. Farewell, Wolf—Grandmother's waiting.'"

- Tighten the Wolf's phrasing to keep his oily charm while avoiding clunky info-dump. Revise: "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time." → "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar — follow that and you'll be right on time." (Keeps clue but reads smoother.)

- Avoid the line that explicitly states Red "steeled herself to hurry" as internal narration; show it physically. Replace "Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers." with a concise action-beat: "Red tightened her hood and quickened her step, fingers curled around the basket — she wouldn't stop for flowers."

- Remove or soften the Wolf's final "Happy trails—until we meet again." If you want lingering menace, keep it but make it more sly and less overtly reciprocal: e.g., "Good trails, child. Until our paths cross." (Keeps theatrical menace without promising future meeting too plainly.)

- Hyphenate "deer track" to "deer-track" when used as a compound modifier (if you prefer tighter fairy-tale diction): "I'll take the deer-track."

- Cut one instance of the idea that Red is anxious about shadows: earlier lines already establish unease. If that thread needs to remain, keep only one crisp instance (the branch across wicker + tightened fingers) and delete the other similar lines to avoid repetition.

- Keep the wolf's flattery but vary wording so he echoes Red without repeating her exact phrasing verbatim too often. E.g., change "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step." to "Your memory is a bright lantern, child — it will light a quicker road." (Preserves poetic voice and manipulative compliment.)

- Ensure the final exchange clearly shows Red chooses the shortcut (touch-point). Make her decision active and immediate: end her line with the choice and a leaving action (e.g., "'I'll take the deer-track,' she said, and set off along the narrow trail.")
