=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You point with your muzzle toward the narrow deer track and say it is a quicker way to Grandmother’s cottage.

Narrator: You see a breath of steam from the basket blow down the deer track eagerly, as if it, too, knows the way.

red: You ask if it is safe and whether the track still leads to Grandmother’s door without getting lost.

red: You note aloud that the deer track is stitched with tiny hoof-prints and it makes you think of Grandmother’s stitching lessons.

wolf: You assure her the track meets the main path by the old birch with the lightning scar.

red: You repeat the landmark—"the lightning-scarred birch"—to fix it in your mind, glancing at your basket as if weighing time.

wolf: You praise her careful memory when she names the birch, calling it "a bright mind's lantern."

Narrator: You adjust your red hood and tell yourself you will hurry and not dawdle for flowers.

red: You decide to take the path and bid the wolf farewell.

wolf: You reply with a smooth, parting flourish: "Happy trails until we meet again!"

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* You care because you are responsible for Grandmother and the basket; speaking organizes your duty into action.
* You want to ensure safety and reach Grandmother without delay; reassurance will quiet your worry.
* You are trying to confirm facts so you can choose the right path without seeming rude or foolish.
* You aim to appear polite and sensible while still following your curiosity about helpful shortcuts.
* You hide a small wish to be admired for being thoughtful and brave; you will let that wish guide a momentary risk.
* Your current mood is earnest and a little anxious—hopeful that haste will be rewarded but susceptible to persuasion.
* You feel tugged between obedience to counsel and a desire to be useful and quick; your question is a hedge against regret.
* You repeat landmarks aloud to fix them in your mind and to buy yourself time to decide.
* You choose the shortcut to be efficient and to protect Grandmother’s comfort; you frame your farewell as a firm, kind closure.

wolf:
* You speak to shape the young traveler’s choice; your suggestion is a soft steering of the situation toward your advantage.
* You want the child off the main path and moving where you can predict and control her timing.
* You are trying to mask hunger and intent beneath civility; flattery and precise landmarks thinly veil your aim.
* You hide the threat in pleasant language, presenting guidance as concern so that resistance seems rude.
* Your current mood is composed and expectant—pleased when plans slot into place, amused by the child’s literalness.
* You praise memory and neatness to build trust and to make your suggestion feel like an earned idea.
* You aim to leave the interaction with the child committed to your course, comfortable enough to part without suspicion.
* Your parting flourish is designed to sound sincere while securing the promise of solitude you prefer.
