- Delete "Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam." It reads like awkward narration and interrupts the exchange; show Red clutching the basket instead if needed.
- Remove "The hoofprints were small and neat." It's unnecessary detail and breaks pacing; if you want a sensory beat, replace with a short action tied to Red ("She glanced at the narrow ruts, then back to the Wolf.") to keep it scene-focused.
- Trim the repeated stage directions for Little Red. Replace "Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers." with a brief, characterful action + line that preserves her voice, e.g.: Red tugs her hood tighter. "All right. I’ll take the deer track—thank you, but I must go."
- Soften or tighten the Wolf's simile "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step." Consider either keeping a shorter compliment in his oily cadence ("Bright memory. It will find the birch for you.") or keep the existing line but remove extra adjectives to avoid purple prose.
- Combine and simplify Red’s farewell to reduce repetition: change "Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—goodbye, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting." to "I'll take the deer track. Thank you. Grandmother's waiting." Keeps politeness and hurry without stilted repetition.
- Keep the shortcut touch-point explicit and decisive: ensure the line where Red accepts the shortcut is a spoken decision (see suggested replacement above) rather than purely narration.
- Optional: add a tiny hesitation beat in Red's dialogue (a short comma or pause) before she agrees, to show her naivety and thought process without long narration (e.g., "Is it—will it still lead to Grandmother's?" … "All right. I'll take it.").
- Verify no mention of the Wolf's hunger or other forbidden foreshadowing appears elsewhere in the scene.
