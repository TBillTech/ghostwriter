- Remove the sentence "Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam." It reads oddly and personifies the basket in a way that distracts. Replace with a small physical beat showing Red's attachment to the basket (e.g., "She hugged the basket closer" or "The basket creaked against her arm").

- Replace repeated "Little Red said" tags with action beats to vary rhythm and keep voice: use tags like "Red hesitated," "Red tightened her hood," "Red said softly," or simply a beat before the line. Example changes:
  - Change "Little Red hesitated, 'Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?'" → "Red hesitated. 'Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?'"
  - Change "Little Red said, 'I remember the birch.'" → "Red nodded. 'I remember the birch.'"
  - Change "Little Red said, 'Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—farewell, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting.'" → "Red clutched the basket. 'I'll take the deer-track. Thank you. Farewell, Wolf—Grandmother's waiting.'"

- Tighten the Wolf's phrasing to keep his oily charm while avoiding clunky info-dump. Revise: "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time." → "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar — follow that and you'll be right on time." (Keeps clue but reads smoother.)

- Avoid the line that explicitly states Red "steeled herself to hurry" as internal narration; show it physically. Replace "Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers." with a concise action-beat: "Red tightened her hood and quickened her step, fingers curled around the basket — she wouldn't stop for flowers."

- Remove or soften the Wolf's final "Happy trails—until we meet again." If you want lingering menace, keep it but make it more sly and less overtly reciprocal: e.g., "Good trails, child. Until our paths cross." (Keeps theatrical menace without promising future meeting too plainly.)

- Hyphenate "deer track" to "deer-track" when used as a compound modifier (if you prefer tighter fairy-tale diction): "I'll take the deer-track."

- Cut one instance of the idea that Red is anxious about shadows: earlier lines already establish unease. If that thread needs to remain, keep only one crisp instance (the branch across wicker + tightened fingers) and delete the other similar lines to avoid repetition.

- Keep the wolf's flattery but vary wording so he echoes Red without repeating her exact phrasing verbatim too often. E.g., change "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step." to "Your memory is a bright lantern, child — it will light a quicker road." (Preserves poetic voice and manipulative compliment.)

- Ensure the final exchange clearly shows Red chooses the shortcut (touch-point). Make her decision active and immediate: end her line with the choice and a leaving action (e.g., "'I'll take the deer-track,' she said, and set off along the narrow trail.")
