The Wolf inclined forward, "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother’s cottage, a quicker way if you follow it.."
Steam climbs from the basket and drifts down the deer track, as if the bread and jam themselves know the way.
Little Red hesitated, "Is this shortcut safe, and will the deer track still lead to Grandmother’s door without getting us lost??"
Little Red observed, "The deer track is stitched with tiny hoof-prints, just like Grandmother’s stitching lessons.."
The Wolf purred, "Yes, the deer track rejoins the main path by the old birch with the lightning scar; follow it and you will stay on course.."
Little Red glanced down, "The lightning-scarred birch is fixed in my mind as I glance at the basket and weigh the time.."
The Wolf applauded, "Your memory is a bright mind's lantern, child; it steadies your steps and keeps the path clear.."
Red tightens her hood and steels herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers.
Little Red decided, "Then I will take the deer track and bid you farewell, Wolf, and hurry to Grandmother's.."
The Wolf bowed smoothly, "Happy trails until we meet again.!"
