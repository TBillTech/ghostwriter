=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm dialog beats as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
Wolf smirks. "Soft and practiced, I offer warmth, not fear. The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace."

He lets the last word ripple, repeating "quicker" with an extra sweetness.

Red clutches the basket. "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet."

The wind shifts, carrying the scent of jam farther than her voice can reach. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight.

A branch slides across the wicker. Her fingers tighten until it creaks. The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late."

"Is there a quicker way? Would it be safe, please?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative lines to give the readers clarity and flavor, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution (but do not make this explicit).

* [Clarity] wolf points with his muzzle toward a narrow deer track and says it is a quicker way to grandmother’s cottage
* [Flavor] a breath of steam from the basket blows down the deer track eagerly, as if it, too, knows the way
* [Clarity] red asks if it is safe and if it still leads to grandmother’s door without getting lost

* [Clarity] wolf assures red the track meets the main path by the old birch with the lightning scar

* [Flavor] wolf praises her careful memory when she names the lightning-scarred birch, calling it “a bright mind’s lantern”
* [Clarity] red adjusts her red hood and tells herself she will hurry and not dawdle for flowers
* [Clarify] Red decides to take the path, and bids wolf farewell.
* [Flavor] Wolf, replies, "happy trails until we meet again!"


=== RESPONSE ===
* [Clarity] wolf tilts his head toward a narrow deer track and says it is a quicker way to grandmother’s cottage

* [Clarity] red says she will not stop for flowers and will hurry as mother asked
* [Flavor] red clutches the basket, then loosens her grip as if the promise steadies her
* [Clarity] wolf offers to walk beside her for the first few steps, “only to the log,” he says

* [Flavor] wolf feigns mild offense, then bows with a velvet smile and “only a suggestion, of course”
* [Clarity] red thanks him for the direction and sets her boots onto the deer track
* [Flavor] the shadows thin for a breath, and a thread of sun lights the start of the shortcut like a blessing
* [Clarity] wolf reminds her to watch for the white birch and the path will find her feet again
* [Flavor] wolf hums a soft, syrupy tune that follows behind her like a trailing ribbon
* [Clarity] red says farewell and promises to tell grandmother she hurried
* [Flavor] wolf replies that duty loves a swift step and “happy trails until we meet again”
