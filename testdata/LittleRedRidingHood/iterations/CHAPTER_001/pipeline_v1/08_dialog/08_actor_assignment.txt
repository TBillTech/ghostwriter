=== SYSTEM ===
Assign dialog lines to actors as 'id: line' entries.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* [Clarity] wolf points with his muzzle toward a narrow deer track and says it is a quicker way to grandmother’s cottage
* [Flavor] a breath of steam from the basket blows down the deer track eagerly, as if it, too, knows the way
* [Clarity] red asks if it is safe and if it still leads to grandmother’s door without getting lost
* [Flavor] red notes the deer track is stitched with tiny hoof-prints and thinks of grandmother’s stitching lessons
* [Clarity] wolf assures red the track meets the main path by the old birch with the lightning scar
* [Clarity] red repeats the landmark to remember it and glances at her basket as if weighing time
* [Flavor] wolf praises her careful memory when she names the lightning-scarred birch, calling it “a bright mind’s lantern”
* [Clarity] red adjusts her red hood and tells herself she will hurry and not dawdle for flowers
* [Clarify] Red decides to take the path, and bids wolf farewell.
* [Flavor] Wolf, replies, "happy trails until we meet again!"

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You point with your muzzle toward the narrow deer track and say it is a quicker way to Grandmother’s cottage.

Narrator: You see a breath of steam from the basket blow down the deer track eagerly, as if it, too, knows the way.

red: You ask if it is safe and whether the track still leads to Grandmother’s door without getting lost.

red: You note aloud that the deer track is stitched with tiny hoof-prints and it makes you think of Grandmother’s stitching lessons.

wolf: You assure her the track meets the main path by the old birch with the lightning scar.

red: You repeat the landmark—"the lightning-scarred birch"—to fix it in your mind, glancing at your basket as if weighing time.

wolf: You praise her careful memory when she names the birch, calling it "a bright mind's lantern."

Narrator: You adjust your red hood and tell yourself you will hurry and not dawdle for flowers.

red: You decide to take the path and bid the wolf farewell.

wolf: You reply with a smooth, parting flourish: "Happy trails until we meet again!"
