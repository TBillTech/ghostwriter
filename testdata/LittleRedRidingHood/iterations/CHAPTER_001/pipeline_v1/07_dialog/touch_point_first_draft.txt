The Wolf offered, "Such a bright little traveler. I know a shorter way—a kindness—that would spare you the wait. If you trust me, I’ll lead you there."

Red clutched her basket tighter. "Mother told me I must keep to the path."

The Wolf purred, "I offer a sly shortcut, dear traveler—a kindness that spares you the wait. Your mother need never know; trust me, and we’ll slip ahead together, just out of sight."

He lifted a paw and gestured to the narrow, mossy deer-track slipping between the pines, and the scene seemed to lean in, the ground answering as if the woods themselves confirmed the shortcut. Red tightened her grip on the basket at her arm; a quiet tremor of trust threaded the air as the path narrowed into a deliberate invitation.

The Wolf murmured, "Indeed—the deer path is the forest speaking plainly, a natural shortcut for those who listen. Deer, being wise, try to avoid danger."

"Grandmother would be happier sooner, and that is why I came. I want to hurry to her with my basket and bring her cheer, please," Red replied.

"Such a bright traveler; your care for Grandmother shines in your eyes," the Wolf promised. "The deer path is a quick shortcut that will save time and keep Grandmother from worrying. Trust me, and we’ll take it together, swift and quiet as the forest itself."

Red hesitated. "Thank you kindly. I’ll try the shorter way, as long as I stay on the safe path to bring Grandmother cheer and make her proud."

"Imagine the pride in their eyes when you arrive sooner than they expect," the Wolf assured. "There’s a quiet deer path—the forest itself nudges for those who listen—that will carry you there faster and with less fuss. If you trust me, I’ll guide you, swift and unseen, so you’re at Grandmother’s door before doubt can catch up."

With a swift, low gesture, the Wolf slipped ahead onto the deer path, a quiet vow to beat them to the door. The forest seemed to exhale around Red, and the basket steadied at her elbow.
