=== SYSTEM ===
You write third-person narrative prose without quotation marks.

=== USER ===
You are writing third-person narrative prose that bridges or frames the surrounding dialog.

Rules:
- Do not use quotation marks.
- Keep the voice consistent with the current chapter’s style and scene.
- Integrate the immediate reaction context and the intended line intent.
- Be concise but evocative. Just a sentence or two. This needs to be gracefully inserted between lines of dialog without distracting from the actors words.
- Avoid actor attributions; this is narration, not a spoken line.

Context (may be partial and pre-formatted):

{'factoids': ['Basket of Goodies', 'Red Hood'], 'actors': ['Red', 'Wolf']}

{
  "Factoids": [
    {
      "name": "Basket of Goodies",
      "description": "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam."
    },
    {
      "name": "Red Hood",
      "description": "A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother."
    }
  ]
}

Active actors: Red, Wolf
Scene: {'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

Recent dialog context (tail):
{
  "Red": [
    "Mother told me I must keep to the path.",
    "Grandmother would be happier sooner, and that is why I came. I want to hurry to her with my basket and bring her cheer, please.",
    "Thank you kindly. I paused a moment, then I’ll try the shorter way, as long as I stay on the safe path to bring Grandmother cheer and make her proud."
  ],
  "Wolf": [
    "Such a bright little traveler. I know a shorter way—a kindness—that would spare you the wait. If you trust me, I’ll lead you there.",
    "Purring softly, I offer a sly shortcut, dear traveler—a kindness that spares you the wait. Your mother need never know; trust me, and we’ll slip ahead together, just out of sight.",
    "Indeed—the deer path is the forest speaking plainly, a natural shortcut for those who listen, dear traveler. Deer, being wise, try to avoid danger.",
    "Such a bright traveler; your care for Grandmother shines in your eyes. The deer path is a quick shortcut that will save time and keep Grandmother from worrying. Trust me, and we’ll take it together, swift and quiet as the forest itself.",
    "Bright traveler, imagine the pride in their eyes when you arrive sooner than they expect. There’s a quiet deer path—the forest itself nudges for those who listen—that will carry you there faster and with less fuss. If you trust me, I’ll guide you, swift and unseen, so you’re at Grandmother’s door before doubt can catch up."

=== RESPONSE ===
The Wolf breaks off with a swift, low gesture, slipping ahead on the deer path a quiet vow to beat the door, while the forest exhales around Red and the basket steadies at her elbow.
