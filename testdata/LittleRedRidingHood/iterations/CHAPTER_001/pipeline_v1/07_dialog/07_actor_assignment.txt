=== SYSTEM ===
Assign dialog lines to actors as 'id: line' entries.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* Clarity: wolf offers a shorter way and calls it a kindness
* Clarity: red repeats that Mother said to keep to the path
* Flavor: wolf tilts his head, Only a suggestion, of course; your mother needn’t know
* Clarity: wolf points to a mossy deer-track that runs between pines
* Clarity: wolf says it is a deer path, and deer try to avoid danger!
* Flavor: red answers plainly, She would want Grandmother happy sooner
* Clarity: wolf claims it saves time so Grandmother will not worry
* Clarity: red hesitates, then decides the shortcut will be helpful
* Flavor: red asks, Does it truly come out by her blue door
* Flavor: wolf smiles, By the very latch, child; think how proud they’ll be when you arrive sooner
* Narrator: So Wolf and Red go their separate ways, as Wolf hurries to get there first.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You offer a shortcut, calling it a kindness — tell her you know a shorter way that would spare her a wait.

red: You repeat what Mother told you, saying plainly that you were to keep to the path.

wolf: You tilt your head and purr, "Only a suggestion, of course; your mother needn’t know," as if it were no harm at all.

Narrator: You point with a paw toward a narrow, mossy deer-track running between the pines.

wolf: You explain that it is a deer path and murmur that deer, being wise, try to avoid danger.

red: You answer simply that Grandmother would be happier sooner, that is why you came.

wolf: You claim the shortcut will save time so Grandmother will not worry, wrapping concern around your flattery.

red: You hesitate a moment, clutch your basket, then decide the shortcut will be helpful and agree to try it.

wolf: You smile and assure, "By the very latch, child; think how proud they’ll be when you arrive sooner."

Narrator: You and the Wolf part ways, the Wolf hurrying with a secret stride to be first to Grandmother’s door.
