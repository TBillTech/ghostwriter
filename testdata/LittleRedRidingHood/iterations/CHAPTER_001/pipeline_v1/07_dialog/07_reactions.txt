=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You offer a shortcut, calling it a kindness — tell her you know a shorter way that would spare her a wait.

red: You repeat what Mother told you, saying plainly that you were to keep to the path.

wolf: You tilt your head and purr, "Only a suggestion, of course; your mother needn’t know," as if it were no harm at all.

Narrator: You point with a paw toward a narrow, mossy deer-track running between the pines.

wolf: You explain that it is a deer path and murmur that deer, being wise, try to avoid danger.

red: You answer simply that Grandmother would be happier sooner, that is why you came.

wolf: You claim the shortcut will save time so Grandmother will not worry, wrapping concern around your flattery.

red: You hesitate a moment, clutch your basket, then decide the shortcut will be helpful and agree to try it.

wolf: You smile and assure, "By the very latch, child; think how proud they’ll be when you arrive sooner."

Narrator: You and the Wolf part ways, the Wolf hurrying with a secret stride to be first to Grandmother’s door.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
red: You hear an offered shortcut and recall your mother's warning, so you repeat plainly that you were to keep to the path.
wolf: You take her literal obedience as an opening — you feign it harmless and press the idea that her mother needn't know, softening the risk.
wolf: You treat the narrator's paw-pointing as proof in the world, turning the narrow, mossy deer-track into tangible evidence for your suggestion.
red: You let his explanation about deer avoiding danger settle like a simple rule, finding his reasoning comfortingly natural and sensible.
wolf: You seize on her wish to hurry to Grandmother, wrapping your shortcut in concern and flattery so it sounds like care, not trickery.
red: You hesitate at the thought of straying but feel the promise of less worry for Grandmother, and that thought pushes you toward agreeing to try the path.
wolf: You relish her acceptance and answer with a smile and assurance, tightening the promise that arriving sooner will make them proud.
Narrator: You note their parting and the Wolf's quick, secret stride, reading his haste as intent to be first at Grandmother's door.
