# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  
2. Make sure to fix the commas, spacing, and capitalization when prose includes quoted dialog.

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
The Wolf offered, "I know a little deer track that will get you to your grandmother faster. Trust me and I'll guide you."

Red clutched her basket tighter. "Mother told me to stay on the path, but Grandmother needs this basket. All right—I'll try the shorter way."

[The Wolf gestures toward a narrow, mossy deer-track.]

[The Wolf slips onto the deer path.]

Red: "Very well. Lead the way."

[Red follows onto the deer path.]

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.

The Wolf offered, "I know a little deer track that will get you to your grandmother faster. Trust me and I'll guide you."

Red clutched her basket tighter. "Mother told me to stay on the path," she said, "but Grandmother needs this basket. All right — I'll try the shorter way."

The Wolf gestured toward a narrow, mossy deer track and slipped onto it. "Very well. Lead the way," Red said, and followed onto the deer path.
