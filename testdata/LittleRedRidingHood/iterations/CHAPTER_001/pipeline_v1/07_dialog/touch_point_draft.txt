Red clutched her basket tighter. "Mother told me to stay on the path," she said, "but Grandmother needs this basket. All right â€” I'll try the shorter way."

The Wolf gestured toward a narrow, mossy deer track and slipped onto it. "Very well. Lead the way," Red said, and followed onto the deer path.
