Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

You are aware of or deeply care about the following details.
* You speak because steering choices is how you gain advantage; conversation is the tool of your influence.
* You want the traveler to change course so you can control timing and solitude; speed and seclusion serve your aims.
* You cloak hunger for opportunity beneath concern; your offer is kindness that conceals leverage.
* You prefer the interaction to feel mutual and voluntary, so you present the plan as harmless and convenient.
* You fear interruption or exposure, so you craft your language to minimize scrutiny and prompt trust.
* Your mood is coaxing and pleased: confidence in the turn of phrase, patient enjoyment of the persuasion.
* You aim to secure cooperation while keeping your true intent obscured, letting the other believe she chose freely.
* Wolf suggested smoothly, "There's a quicker way—a neat turn through the birches, hardly a step off the path; harmless as a flower."
DO NOT verbalise _ANYTHING_ above this line!  
The last 8 lines of dialog are:
Well met, brave little traveler. Which way are you bound toward Grandmother’s house, and I’ll walk with you for a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me.
Such courage shines in you, little one—your steps are guided by a moonlit thread. Which road toward Grandmother’s house are you bound for, and would you let a patient listener walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me?
Bread and jam drift to me on the night air, sweet enough to loosen a wary heart. Which road toward Grandmother's house will you take, and may I walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me?
That red hood brightens this dark wood, little traveler—such a soft glow that even shadows lean closer. Walk with me a stretch, and you may share a tiny secret; I’ll listen with patience and keep your pace steady.
That warmth deserves a straight, unhurried path. Is Grandmother's house nearby, or must we walk a while to reach it?
Bright hood you wear, child—the forest itself seems to lean closer. I’ll walk with you a stretch if you share that tiny secret; such small truths have a way of smoothing the road. Trust a patient listener, and the way to Grandmother’s door may open a little wider.
Your courage lights the path, little traveler. Which road toward Grandmother’s house do you mean to take, and I’ll walk with you a stretch if you share a tiny secret with me—my hunger ticking softly in the shade as we go?
That road will feel long for such small feet; you might tire before Grandmother’s door. I’ll walk with you a stretch, if you share a tiny secret with me. Trust a patient listener and a steady pace—the path may open a little wider for us.
The director now expects you to say something that matches your character.  You should definitely segue a response to the last N lines of dialog and consider responding according to your reaction.  The director gives you this prompt:
Reaction: You tell yourself your worried warning about the long path sounded caring enough to make a helpful suggestion feel natural.
Line intent: You offer a quicker way—a neat little turn through the birches, hardly a step off the path, and you make it sound as harmless as a flower.

Do not just repeat back the director's words, even if he tries to put words in your mouth.
DO NOT describe your own body language, that is weird. Keep your response to three sentences or less.
DO respond to the prior dialog, if there was any.
DO NOT repeat yourself.
Now, say more or less the same thing in your own words and voice. 

=== RESPONSE ===
That long road will tire such small feet, dear traveler. There’s a neat turn through the birches—a quick shortcut, hardly a step off the path, as harmless as a flower. If you share your tiny secret with a patient listener, I’ll walk with you at a steady pace to Grandmother’s door.
