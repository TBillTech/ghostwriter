Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You say the path will be long for such small feet; you worry she might tire before she reaches Grandmother.

wolf: You offer a quicker way—a neat little turn through the birches, hardly a step off the path, and you make it sound as harmless as a flower.

red: You breathe the word “shortcut?” softly and let your eyes follow the brighter thread of light between the trees.

wolf: You assure her it will rejoin the path again before the old stump by the brook, as if you’d walked it a hundred times.

wolf: You let your voice purr like warm honey, “Only a suggestion, of course,” and you tilt your head with mock concern.

red: You tell yourself Grandmother will be grateful if you arrive sooner, and you say, “I’ll go that way then.”

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* You feel responsible for another's comfort and safety; that duty is why you speak.
* You want to shorten the journey because arriving sooner will ease your worry and fulfill your promise.
* You also desire to remain polite and obedient to guidance you perceive as kind.
* You are tempted by hope—an imagined relief for the ailing one—and this softens your caution.
* You hide a niggling anxiety about leaving the path; you frame your choice as practicality to soothe that worry.
* Your mood is tentative but warming: curiosity lifts the edge of your fear, and earnestness steadies your voice.
* You aim to accept the suggestion without causing offense, to keep the encounter pleasant and the goal prioritized.

wolf:
* You speak because steering choices is how you gain advantage; conversation is the tool of your influence.
* You want the traveler to change course so you can control timing and solitude; speed and seclusion serve your aims.
* You cloak hunger for opportunity beneath concern; your offer is kindness that conceals leverage.
* You prefer the interaction to feel mutual and voluntary, so you present the plan as harmless and convenient.
* You fear interruption or exposure, so you craft your language to minimize scrutiny and prompt trust.
* Your mood is coaxing and pleased: confidence in the turn of phrase, patient enjoyment of the persuasion.
* You aim to secure cooperation while keeping your true intent obscured, letting the other believe she chose freely.
