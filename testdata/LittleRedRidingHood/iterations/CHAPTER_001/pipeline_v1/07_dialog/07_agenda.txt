=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
wolf: You offer a shortcut, calling it a kindness — tell her you know a shorter way that would spare her a wait.

red: You repeat what Mother told you, saying plainly that you were to keep to the path.

wolf: You tilt your head and purr, "Only a suggestion, of course; your mother needn’t know," as if it were no harm at all.

Narrator: You point with a paw toward a narrow, mossy deer-track running between the pines.

wolf: You explain that it is a deer path and murmur that deer, being wise, try to avoid danger.

red: You answer simply that Grandmother would be happier sooner, that is why you came.

wolf: You claim the shortcut will save time so Grandmother will not worry, wrapping concern around your flattery.

red: You hesitate a moment, clutch your basket, then decide the shortcut will be helpful and agree to try it.

wolf: You smile and assure, "By the very latch, child; think how proud they’ll be when you arrive sooner."

Narrator: You and the Wolf part ways, the Wolf hurrying with a secret stride to be first to Grandmother’s door.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* You feel duty-bound to follow instructions you were given; saying so anchors your choice in obligation.
* You care deeply about making the person you serve feel better quickly; timeliness animates your decision.
* You are polite and literal; your statement is meant to be plain truth rather than argument.
* You worry about disappointing those who trust you; that worry pushes you toward choices that promise efficiency.
* You are susceptible to kindness and reassurance because you prefer to believe people mean well.
* You want reassurance that leaving the prescribed course is safe and not a breach of your promise.
* You hope for approval and a clear reason to change your behavior so you can remain honest with yourself and others.
* You speak to clarify duty and to buy time to weigh a tempting suggestion; your words are a gentle test.
* Your aim in the interaction is to secure an acceptable shortcut that preserves your obligation while relieving worry.

wolf:
* You aim to alter another’s choices through charm and suggestion; proposing an alternative is a means to that end.
* You wrap self-interest in concern; the kindness you offer conceals a strategic objective.
* You hunger for opportunity and for quiet access to a desired prize; persuasion is the tool to create that opening.
* You hide predatory intent behind civility; your true motive is secrecy and advantage, not benevolence.
* You feel confident and amused; the exchange is a small game of influence you expect to win.
* You fear witnesses and straightforward resistance; you therefore prefer subtlety and plausible deniability.
* You want the other to accept the deviation willingly, to believe it is for their benefit, and to keep the choice unsaid to authority.
* You speak to flatten suspicion and accelerate movement; every flattering phrase is crafted to narrow options.
* Your objective in the interaction is to secure consent to the alternate route and to set events in motion that advantage you.
