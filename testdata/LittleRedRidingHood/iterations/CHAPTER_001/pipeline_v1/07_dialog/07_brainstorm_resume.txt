=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm dialog beats as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother.


# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
{
  "Story-Relative-To": {
    "Red": "Eager to help, trusts strangers.",
    "Wolf": "Hungry, looking for an opportunity.",
    "Forest Path": "Quiet, but shadows watch."
  }
}

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
She curtsied. "Please forgive me; I must hurry to Grandmother now and stay on the safe path. Thank you for your kindness; I’ll go straight to Grandmother and do my best to be brave."

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Forest Path', 'description': 'A winding dirt trail beneath tall, shadowed pines. Shafts of light\nthread through the branches; birds rustle, then fall silent when the\nwind shifts. The air smells of damp earth and sweet jam.\n', 'props': [{'name': 'Basket', 'significance': 'Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust', 'description': "A small wicker basket filled with bread and jam, carried on Red's arm."}, {'name': 'Red Hood', 'significance': 'Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods', 'description': 'A bright red cloak and hood, a gift from Grandmother that draws the eye.'}]}

# Actors
Here are the actors in the scene:
Red, Wolf

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative lines to give the readers clarity and flavor, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real.

=== RESPONSE ===
* [Clarity] wolf steps from the shade, eyes gentle, tone smooth, and asks where red is headed
* [Clarity] red answers plainly that she is going to Grandmother with the basket of goodies
* [Clarity] wolf nods with feigned concern and says the path is long for such small feet
* [Clarity] wolf suggests a quicker way, a neat little turn through the birches, hardly a step off the path
* [Clarity] red repeats “shortcut?” softly and glances at the brighter thread of light between trees
* [Clarity] red admits Mama said to keep to the safe path and not talk to strangers
* [Clarity] wolf assures that the shortcut touches the path again before the old stump by the brook
* [Clarity] wolf promises Grandmother will be grateful if red arrives sooner
* [Flavor] wolf’s voice purrs like warm honey as he says, only a suggestion, of course
* [Flavor] red clutches the basket, then loosens her grip when he compliments her red hood
* [Flavor] birds fall quiet; a breeze lifts the red hood like a bright sail
* [Flavor] wolf tilts his head, counting heartbeats, and murmurs, such dutiful care for Grandmother
* [Flavor] red hums a nursery tune under her breath, then stops, cheeks pink with apology for dawdling
* [Flavor] wolf repeats her words back to her, yes, the safe path, safer still if you arrive before the sun tilts
* [Flavor] red asks if the shortcut is kind to ankles and skirts, and if the jam will not jostle
* [Flavor] wolf chuckles softly and points with his nose, the birches make a gentle lane, soft as a cradle
* [Flavor] red peeks at her own shoes, whispers that she wants to be brave and quick, both
* [Flavor] wolf leans away as if to keep a proper distance, adding, your mother needn’t know, only Grandmother’s smile will tell
* [Clarity] red hesitates, then says she will look at the birches and decide, because she promised to be careful
* [Flavor] the scent of sweet jam seems to drift toward the darker trees; wolf’s eyes flick there and back with a mild, polite blink
* [Flavor] wolf offers to walk beside the path and point the turning, only until she sees the brook’s silver thread
* [Clarity] red thanks him for the advice but says she mustn’t stray far, and asks how to know she is still near the path
* [Clarity] wolf tells her to keep the red hood in the sunlit stripes; where the light stripes fade, return a step and try again
* [Flavor] red whispers, that sounds like a game, then bites her lip and adds, but I will not play long
* [Flavor] wolf’s smile is small and courteous as he says, think how proud Grandmother will be when you knock before the kettle sings
