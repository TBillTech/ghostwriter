Red walked the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fell in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shone bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bent around a black-barked tree and the forest deepened a shade. She stepped along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hung on her arm, creaking with each swing as if it carried trust as much as bread and jam. She hummed a nursery tune while pine needles softened her steps and pale dust rose and fell behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leaned from the verge, nodding as she passed. She kept to the trail.

Wolf moved parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. He lifted his muzzle toward the trail-stirred air, catching the sweetness of jam that drifted through the pines. When Red paused, he stilled; when she moved, he resumed, each step measured, watchful and patient in the watching forest.

Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood and a basket in hand?" 

The forest quieted. 

"To my Grandmother's cottage, please." She hugged the basket closer. "Bread and jam — she is ill." 

"And what treasures have you tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" Wolf asked, voice as smooth as oil. "How far is she from here, if you don't mind my asking?" 

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump — not far."

Wolf smirks. "Soft and practiced, I offer warmth, not fear. The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees, and I can guide you to it if your courage keeps pace."

He lets the last word ripple, repeating "quicker" with an extra sweetness.

Red clutches the basket. "The shadows feel strange. My eyes aren't used to them yet."

The wind shifts, carrying the scent of jam farther than her voice can reach. A jay cackles once and vanishes, leaving a silence heavier than the basket's weight.

A branch slides across the wicker. Her fingers tighten until it creaks. The crooked stump throws a long shadow across her boots, and her next step falters on loose needles.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you. Grandmother is waiting; I mustn't be late."

"Is there a quicker way? Would it be safe, please?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads through the pines as the path tilts toward a choice the forest keeps for itself.

The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

The Wolf inclined forward, "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam.

Little Red hesitated, "Is that shortcut safe? Will it still lead to Grandmother's?"

The hoofprints were small and neat.

The Wolf said, "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time."

Little Red said, "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step."

Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers.

Little Red said, "Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—goodbye, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting."

The Wolf bowed, "Happy trails—until we meet again."
