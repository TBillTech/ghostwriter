"The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees," he purred, "and I can guide you—if your courage keeps pace." He let the sibilant linger and murmured, "Quicker, little one..." He licked his lips; a faint musk edged the air.

A shadow of a branch twitches across the wicker; Red clutches the basket and the wicker creaks under her fingers.

"The shadows feel odd. My eyes can't see well there yet."

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you, but Grandmother waits—I mustn't keep her. But a quicker way? Would that be safe?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads the pines; the path forks, and the woods hush around the choice.
