You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Red walks the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fall in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shines bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bends around an oak with black bark and the forest deepens a shade. Red steps along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hangs on her arm, creaking with each swing. It seems to carry trust as much as bread and jam. Pine needles soften her steps and pale dust lifts behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leans from the verge, nodding as Red passes. Red keeps to the trail. Red hums a nursery tune as she keeps to the path.

The wolf moves parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. The wolf lifts his muzzle to the trail air, noting the drift of jam through the pines. When Red pauses, the wolf stills; when Red moves, the wolf resumes, each step measured, patient and watchful in the dim forest.

---

Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood?"

The pines listened.

"To my Grandmother's cottage." Red clutched the basket.

"And what have you tucked into that pretty basket for a sick grandmother?" he said, all slipper and smile.

"Bread and jam—Grandmother's ill."

The wolf's tail flicked once. "How far is she from here?" he asked.

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump—not far."

"Three tall pines... the crooked stump. Not far at all," he echoed softly.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
Danger hinted at in the dark trees and Wolf's smile.

# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
"The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees," he purred, "and I can guide you—if your courage keeps pace." He let the sibilant linger and murmured, "Quicker, little one..." He licked his lips; a faint musk edged the air.

A shadow of a branch twitches across the wicker; Red clutches the basket and the wicker creaks under her fingers.

"The shadows feel odd. My eyes can't see well there yet."

A jay cackles once and goes; the forest hush that follows presses against the path.

The crooked stump's shadow slides over her boots; she falters on loose needles. She glances at the dappled light on the deer track, takes an involuntary step, then straightens.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you, but Grandmother waits—I mustn't keep her. But a quicker way? Would that be safe?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads the pines; the path forks, and the woods hush around the choice.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove or tighten: "He let the sibilant linger and murmured, 'Quicker, little one...'" — redundant with the earlier line; replace with a single compact beat that shows his sibilant cadence (e.g., "Quicker, little one," he purred, the s hiss soft as smoke).

- Remove or rephrase: "He licked his lips; a faint musk edged the air." — too explicit about predation. Replace with a subtler physical cue (e.g., "He smiled, and the air smelled faintly of brine and old leaves.") to keep menace implied, not stated.

- Replace the flat line, "The shadows feel odd. My eyes can't see well there yet." with Red's more literal, polite voice and mannerism—make it a short, character-authentic sentence (e.g., Red: "The shadows make me nervous. I can't see well there yet.") so her voice reads true.

- Trim: "A jay cackles once and goes; the forest hush that follows presses against the path." — long and slightly melodramatic. Shorten to one crisp beat to maintain pace (e.g., "A jay cackles; the woods fall quieter.").

- Tighten the sequence around the crooked stump and deer track: compress three beats into two clearer ones. Remove one descriptive repetition (either "falters on loose needles" or "takes an involuntary step") and keep whichever shows Red's small, distracted movement most vividly.

- Add a brief wolf dialog echo to demonstrate his tactic of repeating Red's phrasing (character trait): after Red mentions the crooked stump, insert a soft echo from Wolf: "The crooked stump," he repeated, slow and pleased. This heightens manipulation without adding exposition.

- Insert one tiny narrative action between Red's lines to ground dialog (she should clutch basket/muse as per mannerisms). For example, after Red's "Grandmother waits..." line, add "She clutched the basket rim a breath tighter." This balances dialog with action and keeps her physical habit present.

- Rework the fork/moment of choice to be leaner and more tensioned. Replace "A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads the pines; the path forks, and the woods hush around the choice." with two short sentences that prioritize danger hint and decision (e.g., "A pine needle crunches. The path forks; the woods tighten like a held breath.").

- Remove explicit foreshadowing of the wolf's hunger anywhere else in the scene. Keep menace in his smile, tone, and small physical cues rather than direct statements.

- Watch repetition of "quicker/quick" — the draft uses "quickest" and "quicker" multiple times. Keep one instance in Wolf's first line, then vary his phrasing (e.g., "shorter way," "a little-known path") to avoid echoing.

- Ensure Red's politeness shows—consider changing her "But a quicker way? Would that be safe?" to "A quicker way? Please—would that be safe?" if you want to tilt her toward helpfulness/pleading; otherwise leave but keep one "please/thank you" in the exchange.

- Final pass: read aloud to check cadence—keep Wolf's lines smooth and slightly elongated; keep Red's short, earnest, literal. Remove any remaining lines where narration tells rather than shows (e.g., "the forest hush presses") and make them sensory or physical instead.
