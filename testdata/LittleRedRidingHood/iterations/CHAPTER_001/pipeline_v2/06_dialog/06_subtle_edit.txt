You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as she kept to the trail with a wicker basket creaking on her arm like a quiet promise; pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her as she passed tufted blue flowers and a crooked stump, the hood shining against tall, shadowed pines while the jam-sweet scent threaded the air. From the bramble a sleek wolf moved parallel, low and silent, lifting his muzzle to the trail and speaking in a velvet, honeyed voice that asked where she was bound and what treasures she carried, murmuring of a quicker way and offering to guide her by a narrow deer track that would rejoin the main road by a birch with a lightning scar; the forest hushed, a jay cackled and vanished, shadows lengthened, a branch brushed the basket and made it creak, and Red tightened her hood, fingers clamping the handles when the wolf, smiling with bright teeth, promised the shortcut would cut straight to her grandmother's cottage. She hesitated, voice small, naming the crooked stump and the three tall pines that marked the cottage, and when the wolf assured her—softly, insistently—that the deer track would bring her to the birch and set her right on time, she glanced from the narrow ruts back to the path, tugged her hood tighter, remembered her grandmother waiting, and, resolute not to linger for flowers, accepted the wolf’s guidance and hurried away along the hidden track.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines. I notice small things: the blue flowers nodding, dust rising behind me, the crooked stump casting a long shadow that makes my next step hesitate. Today the black-barked oak looms where the path bends and the forest deepens a shade; pine needles soften my steps and pale dust lifts. When the wolf appears from the bramble his voice is velvet and the jam on my air smells like comfort and worry. My fingers clamp the wicker when a branch brushes it and the jay’s single cackle makes me flinch; I hug the basket closer and tell him Grandmother is ill and waiting with bread and jam. He speaks sweetly of a quicker way, promises the deer track will rejoin the road by the birch with the lightning scar, and I remember the birch—so, with my hood tugged tighter and my resolve set not to be late, I accept the shortcut and hurry along the hidden ruts, trusting my bright hood and my small, steady stride to carry me straight.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sit easy beneath my coat as I pad low through the bramble, smelling jam like an invitation on the trail where sunlight threads between pines. I watch her—bright hood, steady stride, the creak of woven promises—and I choose my words soft as oil, letting sweetness draw the shape of her answers. When she pauses by the crooked stump, when a branch brushes her basket and her fingers tighten, I slip my suggestion forward like a friendly hand: a narrow deer track, a quicker way, a secret map that rejoins the road by the birch with the lightning scar. I linger on the syllables, let my teeth flash a polite smile, and press the shortcut into her head with the easy confidence of one who knows the forest's hush. She hesitates, remembers the birch, tugs her hood, and because her hope to be timely outweighs her fear, she accepts; I bow with a silk of a promise and go patient for what comes next.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she wanders beneath pines, the hood bright against the deepening shade where the black-barked oak bends the trail. My undergrowth breathes jam and the tufted blue leans toward her as pine needles soften each step; a branch reaches and brushes the wicker until it creaks. I let a sleek shape slip through my bramble—low, measured, hungry—and watch him lift his muzzle to the jam-scented air, his voice smoothing the hush. A jay's cackle breaks the moment and then silence settles like leaf litter; the wolf names a secret deer track that runs thin and sure beneath my feet and promises it will meet the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. She tugs her hood tighter and follows the narrow ruts, and I fold the scene into my long quiet, keeping the crossroads and the birch tucked between my roots as she hurries on.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The Wolf greets Red and asks where she's going.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood and a basket in hand?" 

The forest quieted. 

"To my Grandmother's cottage." She hugged the basket closer.

"And what treasures have you tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" Wolf asked, voice as smooth as oil.
"Bread and jam — she is ill." 
 
"I'm sorry to hear that. How far is she from here, if you don't mind my asking?" 

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump — not far."

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove or replace "The forest quieted." — it's a blunt narration beat. Instead add a short, evocative line that belongs to scene-setting or to an actor (e.g., have Wolf's next line pick up the hush: "The forest seemed to lean closer," or "The pines listened,"), but keep it minimal.

- Trim Wolf's first question to avoid clumsy doubling ("bright hood" + "basket in hand"). Suggested rewrite: Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood?" or "— and that basket?" (choose one).

- Replace the simile "voice as smooth as oil" with something less literal and more in-voice for Wolf (e.g., "his voice low and oily" or "he said, all slipper and smile"). Keep the sly menace, but avoid heavy literal similes.

- Make Red's reply more character-specific and concise. Replace "To my Grandmother's cottage." / "She hugged the basket closer." with a single short line plus a brief, natural action: Red: "To my grandmother's cottage." (then a stage direction: Red clutched the basket.) Avoid a character narrating their own motion.

- Tighten the exchange about the basket's contents. Combine into one natural line for Red: instead of separate lines, use: Red: "Bread and jam—Grandmother's ill." (Keeps her plainness and politeness.)

- Shorten Wolf's follow-up question to remove filler "if you don't mind my asking?" Keep his tone coaxing but economical: Wolf: "How far is she from here?" or Wolf: "How far is that cottage?" Consider adding a sly echo of Red's phrasing to show manipulation: Wolf: "Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump, you say? Not far, then."

- Remove redundancy between "And what treasures..." and "what tucked inside for a sick grandmother?" They repeat the same idea. Replace the first with a single, characterful solicitation: Wolf: "And what have you tucked inside that pretty basket for a sick grandmother?" or simply Wolf: "What treats march in that basket?"

- Add a brief Wolf line that mirrors Red's phrasing (repetition as manipulation), but avoid implying hunger or predation. Example: after Red names the landmarks, Wolf repeats them softly: Wolf: "Three tall pines... the crooked stump. Not far at all." Keeps his mimicry without foreshadowing he's hungry.

- Ensure all narration remains sparse and belongs to scene-setting, not exposition. Any remaining stage directions should be one short clause (e.g., "Red clutched the basket," "The wolf's tail flicked once") and placed between dialogue lines rather than as separate paragraphs.

- Check tone consistency: make sure Red's lines stay simple and polite (please/thank you if present); Wolf's lines should slip compliments and mimicry subtly rather than outright flattery in every line. Remove any overly florid phrases that clash with the fairy-tale cadence.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.

=== RESPONSE ===
Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood?"

The pines listened.

"To my Grandmother's cottage." Red clutched the basket.

"And what have you tucked into that pretty basket for a sick grandmother?" he said, all slipper and smile.

"Bread and jam—Grandmother's ill."

The wolf's tail flicked once. "How far is she from here?" he asked.

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump—not far."

"Three tall pines... the crooked stump. Not far at all," he echoed softly.
