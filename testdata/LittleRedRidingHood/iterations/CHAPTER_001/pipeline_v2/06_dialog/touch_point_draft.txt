Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood?"

The pines listened.

"To my Grandmother's cottage." Red clutched the basket.

"And what have you tucked into that pretty basket for a sick grandmother?" he said, all slipper and smile.

"Bread and jam—Grandmother's ill."

The wolf's tail flicked once. "How far is she from here?" he asked.

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump—not far."

"Three tall pines... the crooked stump. Not far at all," he echoed softly.
