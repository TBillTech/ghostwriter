You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as she kept to the trail with a wicker basket creaking on her arm like a quiet promise; pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her as she passed tufted blue flowers and a crooked stump, the hood shining against tall, shadowed pines while the jam-sweet scent threaded the air. From the bramble a sleek wolf moved parallel, low and silent, lifting his muzzle to the trail and speaking in a velvet, honeyed voice that asked where she was bound and what treasures she carried, murmuring of a quicker way and offering to guide her by a narrow deer track that would rejoin the main road by a birch with a lightning scar; the forest hushed, a jay cackled and vanished, shadows lengthened, a branch brushed the basket and made it creak, and Red tightened her hood, fingers clamping the handles when the wolf, smiling with bright teeth, promised the shortcut would cut straight to her grandmother's cottage. She hesitated, voice small, naming the crooked stump and the three tall pines that marked the cottage, and when the wolf assured her—softly, insistently—that the deer track would bring her to the birch and set her right on time, she glanced from the narrow ruts back to the path, tugged her hood tighter, remembered her grandmother waiting, and, resolute not to linger for flowers, accepted the wolf’s guidance and hurried away along the hidden track.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—my basket creaks like a promise and the nursery tune keeps my feet steady as the sun slices through the pines. I notice small things: the blue flowers nodding, dust rising behind me, the crooked stump casting a long shadow that makes my next step hesitate. Today the black-barked oak looms where the path bends and the forest deepens a shade; pine needles soften my steps and pale dust lifts. When the wolf appears from the bramble his voice is velvet and the jam on my air smells like comfort and worry. My fingers clamp the wicker when a branch brushes it and the jay’s single cackle makes me flinch; I hug the basket closer and tell him Grandmother is ill and waiting with bread and jam. He speaks sweetly of a quicker way, promises the deer track will rejoin the road by the birch with the lightning scar, and I remember the birch—so, with my hood tugged tighter and my resolve set not to be late, I accept the shortcut and hurry along the hidden ruts, trusting my bright hood and my small, steady stride to carry me straight.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sit easy beneath my coat as I pad low through the bramble, smelling jam like an invitation on the trail where sunlight threads between pines. I watch her—bright hood, steady stride, the creak of woven promises—and I choose my words soft as oil, letting sweetness draw the shape of her answers. When she pauses by the crooked stump, when a branch brushes her basket and her fingers tighten, I slip my suggestion forward like a friendly hand: a narrow deer track, a quicker way, a secret map that rejoins the road by the birch with the lightning scar. I linger on the syllables, let my teeth flash a polite smile, and press the shortcut into her head with the easy confidence of one who knows the forest's hush. She hesitates, remembers the birch, tugs her hood, and because her hope to be timely outweighs her fear, she accepts; I bow with a silk of a promise and go patient for what comes next.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the dust behind her little feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she wanders beneath pines, the hood bright against the deepening shade where the black-barked oak bends the trail. My undergrowth breathes jam and the tufted blue leans toward her as pine needles soften each step; a branch reaches and brushes the wicker until it creaks. I let a sleek shape slip through my bramble—low, measured, hungry—and watch him lift his muzzle to the jam-scented air, his voice smoothing the hush. A jay's cackle breaks the moment and then silence settles like leaf litter; the wolf names a secret deer track that runs thin and sure beneath my feet and promises it will meet the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. She tugs her hood tighter and follows the narrow ruts, and I fold the scene into my long quiet, keeping the crossroads and the birch tucked between my roots as she hurries on.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The Wolf inclined forward, "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam.

Little Red hesitated, "Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?"

The Wolf said, "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time."

Little Red said, "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step."

Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers.

Little Red said, "Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—farewell, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting."

The Wolf bowed, "Happy trails—until we meet again."

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove the sentence "Warmth lifted from the basket in a faint breath of sweet jam." It reads oddly and personifies the basket in a way that distracts. Replace with a small physical beat showing Red's attachment to the basket (e.g., "She hugged the basket closer" or "The basket creaked against her arm").

- Replace repeated "Little Red said" tags with action beats to vary rhythm and keep voice: use tags like "Red hesitated," "Red tightened her hood," "Red said softly," or simply a beat before the line. Example changes:
  - Change "Little Red hesitated, 'Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?'" → "Red hesitated. 'Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?'"
  - Change "Little Red said, 'I remember the birch.'" → "Red nodded. 'I remember the birch.'"
  - Change "Little Red said, 'Then I'll take the deer track. Thank you—farewell, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting.'" → "Red clutched the basket. 'I'll take the deer-track. Thank you. Farewell, Wolf—Grandmother's waiting.'"

- Tighten the Wolf's phrasing to keep his oily charm while avoiding clunky info-dump. Revise: "It rejoins the main path by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that, and you'll be right on time." → "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar — follow that and you'll be right on time." (Keeps clue but reads smoother.)

- Avoid the line that explicitly states Red "steeled herself to hurry" as internal narration; show it physically. Replace "Little Red tightened her hood and steeled herself to hurry, determined not to linger for flowers." with a concise action-beat: "Red tightened her hood and quickened her step, fingers curled around the basket — she wouldn't stop for flowers."

- Remove or soften the Wolf's final "Happy trails—until we meet again." If you want lingering menace, keep it but make it more sly and less overtly reciprocal: e.g., "Good trails, child. Until our paths cross." (Keeps theatrical menace without promising future meeting too plainly.)

- Hyphenate "deer track" to "deer-track" when used as a compound modifier (if you prefer tighter fairy-tale diction): "I'll take the deer-track."

- Cut one instance of the idea that Red is anxious about shadows: earlier lines already establish unease. If that thread needs to remain, keep only one crisp instance (the branch across wicker + tightened fingers) and delete the other similar lines to avoid repetition.

- Keep the wolf's flattery but vary wording so he echoes Red without repeating her exact phrasing verbatim too often. E.g., change "Your memory is a bright lantern, child—handy for a hastening step." to "Your memory is a bright lantern, child — it will light a quicker road." (Preserves poetic voice and manipulative compliment.)

- Ensure the final exchange clearly shows Red chooses the shortcut (touch-point). Make her decision active and immediate: end her line with the choice and a leaving action (e.g., "'I'll take the deer-track,' she said, and set off along the narrow trail.")

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.

=== RESPONSE ===
The Wolf inclined forward. "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

Red hesitated. "Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?"

The Wolf said, "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar — follow that and you'll be right on time."

Red nodded. "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child — it will light a quicker road."

Red tightened her hood and quickened her step, fingers curled around the basket — she wouldn't stop for flowers.

Red clutched the basket. "'I'll take the deer-track,' she said, and set off along the narrow trail. 'Thank you. Farewell, Wolf—Grandmother's waiting,' she called over her shoulder."

The Wolf bowed. "Good trails, child. Until our paths cross."
