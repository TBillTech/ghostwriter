The Wolf inclined forward. "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

The basket creaked against her arm.

Red hesitated. "Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?"

The Wolf said, "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar — follow that and you'll be right on time."

Red nodded. "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child — it will light a quicker road."

Red tightened her hood and quickened her step, fingers curled around the basket — she wouldn't stop for flowers.

Red clutched the basket. "'I'll take the deer-track,' she said, and set off along the narrow trail. 'Thank you. Farewell, Wolf—Grandmother's waiting,' she called over her shoulder."

The Wolf bowed. "Good trails, child." Then, low and quiet, Wolf growled "Until our paths cross again."
