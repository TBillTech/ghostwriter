=== SYSTEM ===
You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

One thing to watch out for is that these actors have tendency to repeat themselves.  If you notice this, point out where some text is redundant and should be removed. The audience won't like hearing the same thing over and over. 

Also watch out for the wrong balance of Narration. A few sentences where needed are OK to paint the picture, but this should be dialog not long prose.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Red walks the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fall in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shines bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bends around an oak with black bark and the forest deepens a shade. Red steps along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hangs on her arm, creaking with each swing. It seems to carry trust as much as bread and jam. Pine needles soften her steps and pale dust lifts behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leans from the verge, nodding as Red passes. Red keeps to the trail. Red hums a nursery tune as she keeps to the path.

The wolf moves parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. The wolf lifts his muzzle to the trail air, noting the drift of jam through the pines. When Red pauses, the wolf stills; when Red moves, the wolf resumes, each step measured, patient and watchful in the dim forest.

---

Wolf purred, "Good morning, little traveler — where are you headed with that bright hood?"

The pines listened.

"To my Grandmother's cottage." Red clutched the basket.

"And what have you tucked into that pretty basket for a sick grandmother?" he said, all slipper and smile.

"Bread and jam—Grandmother's ill."

The wolf's tail flicked once. "How far is she from here?" he asked.

"Past the three tall pines and the crooked stump—not far."

"Three tall pines... the crooked stump. Not far at all," he echoed softly.

---

"The quickest way lies in the hush between the trees," he purred, "and I can guide you—if your courage keeps pace." He let the sibilant linger and murmured, "Quicker, little one..." He licked his lips; a faint musk edged the air.

A shadow of a branch twitches across the wicker; Red clutches the basket and the wicker creaks under her fingers.

"The shadows feel odd. My eyes can't see well there yet."

A jay cackles once and goes; the forest hush that follows presses against the path.

The crooked stump's shadow slides over her boots; she falters on loose needles. She glances at the dappled light on the deer track, takes an involuntary step, then straightens.

Red tugs her hood. "Thank you, but Grandmother waits—I mustn't keep her. But a quicker way? Would that be safe?"

A pine needle crunches underfoot. Sunlight threads the pines; the path forks, and the woods hush around the choice.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should at some point directly address the following touch-point:
The Wolf suggests a shortcut to Grandmother's, and Red decides to take it.

# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
The Wolf inclined forward. "That narrow deer track cuts straight to Grandmother's cottage—a shortcut if you follow it."

The basket creaked against her arm.

Red hesitated. "Will the shortcut lead to Grandmother's?"

The Wolf said, "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar — follow that and you'll be right on time."

Red nodded. "I remember the birch."

The Wolf purred, "Your memory is a bright lantern, child — it will light a quicker road."

Red tightened her hood and quickened her step, fingers curled around the basket — she wouldn't stop for flowers.

Red clutched the basket. "'I'll take the deer-track,' she said, and set off along the narrow trail. 'Thank you. Farewell, Wolf—Grandmother's waiting,' she called over her shoulder."

The Wolf bowed. "Good trails, child." Then, low and quiet, Wolf growled "Until our paths cross again."

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove one of the repeated basket/clutch images. Delete either "The basket creaked against her arm." or the later "Red clutched the basket." (keep just one to avoid redundancy).

- Replace the awkward narrated quote line:
  Current: "'I'll take the deer-track,' she said, and set off along the narrow trail. 'Thank you. Farewell, Wolf—Grandmother's waiting,' she called over her shoulder."
  Suggested rewrite (direct speech + brief gesture): Red tucked the basket closer and called over her shoulder, "I'll take the deer-track. Thank you — farewell, Wolf. Grandmother's waiting."
  (This removes the strange mix of narration inside quotes and keeps it dialog-forward.)

- Tighten/delete internal narration that duplicates action:
  Delete "Red tightened her hood and quickened her step, fingers curled around the basket — she wouldn't stop for flowers." Replace with a short showy action if you want her resolve visible: "Red tightened her hood and stepped onto the narrow trail, not looking at the verge." (Keeps her earnest cadence without repeating clutch/creak imagery.)

- Tone down the final animalistic verb to match Wolf's sly, theatrical manner rather than obvious menace:
  Replace: Then, low and quiet, Wolf growled "Until our paths cross again."
  With: He bowed and let a low, amused purr slip out, "Until our paths cross again."
  (Keeps menace implied via tone rather than blunt growl; preserves his oily charm.)

- Minor clarity/flow tweak to Wolf's birch line: make it sound more suggestive, not overly directive:
  Current: "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar — follow that and you'll be right on time."
  Suggested: "It meets the path again by the birch with the lightning scar. Follow that and you'll be right on time."
  (Split into two sentences to smooth the cadence and match Wolf's sibilant pacing.)

- Remove the extra echo of Red's memory that serves no new purpose:
  Delete or compress "Red nodded. 'I remember the birch.'" If you want to keep acknowledgement, fold it into her spoken line (e.g., Red said, "I remember the birch," right before she steps onto the track) so it doesn't read as a separate redundant beat.

- Optional: Add one small sensory beat to show Red's decision in keeping with her character (short, earnest):
  Insert after she accepts: "She gave a small, polite nod, as if promising." (One quick sentence only — keeps narration light and character-true.)

These changes remove repetition, fix the weird narrated-quote construction, keep the scene dialog-forward, and preserve the writer's voice while sharpening Wolf's manipulative charm.
