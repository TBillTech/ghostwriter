You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
Wolf hasn't eaten in a while.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
Red walks the forest path, humming, basket in hand.

# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Red walks the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fall in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shines bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bends around an oak with black bark and the forest deepens a shade. Red steps along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hangs on her arm, creaking with each swing. It seems to carry trust as much as bread and jam. Pine needles soften her steps and pale dust lifts behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leans from the verge, nodding as Red passes. Red keeps to the trail. Red hums a nursery tune as she keeps to the path.

The wolf moves parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. The wolf lifts his muzzle to the trail air, noting the drift of jam through the pines. When Red pauses, the wolf stills; when Red moves, the wolf resumes, each step measured, patient and watchful in the dim forest.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove the repeated sentence/idea: delete one of the "Red keeps to the trail/path" lines (they read redundant). Keep a single clear instance to honor the touch-point without repetition.
- Vary wording of the two similar humming lines; combine into one smoother line that shows she hums while walking (e.g., "Red hums a nursery tune as she walks, basket in hand").
- Replace "the wolf" with the character name "Wolf" (capitalize) when the narrator refers to him, to avoid pronoun ambiguity and keep character-focused narration.
- Change "drift of jam" to "scent of jam" (more precise, sensory).
- Tighten or remove minor sensory clutter: consider deleting or compressing "pine needles soften her steps and pale dust lifts behind her" into a single succinct image to maintain rhythm.
- Rework "oak with black bark" to a more vivid, slightly idiomatic phrase that keeps the writer's voice (e.g., "gnarled oak" or "an oak whose bark runs almost black"), to avoid a stilted descriptor.
- Replace "the wicker basket hangs on her arm, creaking with each swing" with a shorter image that preserves the basket-as-anchor idea and Red's mannerism (e.g., "Her wicker basket swings at her elbow, a quiet creak and a steady weight — bread, jam, and trust.").
- Smooth sentence rhythm in the Wolf paragraph by reducing short choppy clauses; merge a couple of lines (e.g., "When Red pauses, the wolf stills; when Red moves, the wolf resumes" → "He stills when Red pauses and resumes when she moves") for better cadence while keeping his patient, shadowy stalking.
- Watch repetition of descriptors like "shadowed" and "dim forest" in close succession; choose one strong word and remove the other to keep imagery taut.
- Add one small Red-specific gesture from the character sheet (e.g., "she clutches her basket when a shadow passes" or "she hums softly, fingers tightening on the handle") to reinforce characterization without changing voice.
