Red walks the forest path humming, a basket in her hand. Sunbeams fall in narrow bands, sliding over her hood and the winding dirt trail. The hood shines bright against the tall, shadowed pines as the path bends around an oak with black bark and the forest deepens a shade. Red steps along the trail with a small, steady stride; the wicker basket hangs on her arm, creaking with each swing. It seems to carry trust as much as bread and jam. Pine needles soften her steps and pale dust lifts behind her. A tuft of blue flowers leans from the verge, nodding as Red passes. Red keeps to the trail. Red hums a nursery tune as she keeps to the path.

The wolf moves parallel through the undergrowth, low and quiet between bramble shadows. The wolf lifts his muzzle to the trail air, noting the drift of jam through the pines. When Red pauses, the wolf stills; when Red moves, the wolf resumes, each step measured, patient and watchful in the dim forest.
