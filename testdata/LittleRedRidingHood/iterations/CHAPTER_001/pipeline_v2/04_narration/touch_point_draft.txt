Red stepped along the winding dirt trail, her red hood bright against the pines, a basket in her hand. She hummed a small, steady tune; the wicker creaked softly with each swing. Inside: bread and jam for Grandmother. Shafts of pale light crossed the path; birds stirred in the boughs and a lift of air carried the jam-sweet scent from the basket toward the bracken. Pine needles softened every footfall. She passed a mossy stump, glanced at a cluster of flowers, and moved on.

Wolf paced just inside the bracken, keeping parallel to her course; the forest hid Wolf's paws and breath. The scents reached Wolf when the wind favored him, and he matched her stride—moving silently when she moved, pausing when she paused—following at a careful distance.
