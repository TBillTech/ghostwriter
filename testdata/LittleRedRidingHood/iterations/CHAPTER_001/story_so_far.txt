Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother, and so she walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as she kept to the trail with a wicker basket creaking on her arm like a quiet promise; the pines deepened, pale dust swirled behind her, and she moved on steady little feet past tufted blue flowers and a crooked stump until a sleek wolf, padding parallel through the bramble, lifted his muzzle to the jam-sweet air and began to speak in a velvet voice, asking where she was bound and what treasures she carried, murmuring of quicker ways and offering to guide her by a narrow deer track that would rejoin the main road by a birch with a lightning scar; the forest hushed, a jay cackled once, shadows lengthened, Red tightened her hood, clutched the basket tighter when a branch brushed it, hesitated at the choice, then, mindful of her grandmother waiting and resolute not to linger for flowers, accepted the wolfâ€™s shortcut and hurried away along the hidden track.
