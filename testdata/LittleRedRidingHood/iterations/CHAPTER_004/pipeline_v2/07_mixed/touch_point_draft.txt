Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I've found you, wolf. Your deeds end here."

Whiskers twitched. The wolf purred, "Accusations? Poor Grandmother—aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom, hunter..."

The patchwork shifted; something long and warm moved beneath. The mantle clock kept its slow, indifferent tick.

He pinched the seam; a puff of flour rose and whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath and said, "Flour on the seams, whiskers against my hand, that sour fur-musk—Grandmother's spectacles on a snout."

The nightcap drooped; the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. He lifted the spectacles between forefinger and thumb, held them to the light. "That's no elder's profile—it's a muzzle."

He set the spectacles down slowly. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

The wolf's purr tightened.
