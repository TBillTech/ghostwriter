You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
A hundred yards out the huntsman heard Red's brief, strangled cry, cut then muffled by the pines. He left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He tracked fat wolf pads and claw marks straight to the sill; they did not lead away.

The huntsman circled the cottage once. He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees. He paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered. Its steady tick measured a calm that was forced.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door close soundlessly. Floorboards showed no scuffle. The table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was cold; a ring of condensed steam rimmed the lid. The fire had died to grey. The air told him—fur-musk, flour dust, hearth ash. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed.

Grandmother's quilt bulged—an extra-round mound, too full for an old woman's frame. Grandmother's spectacles glinted on the bolster; powder dented the pillow. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it was long-muzzled. The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age.

His eyes swept rafters, corners, the shadow under the bed. He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drew. Breathe. Count. The mound moved. The scent changed—close, warm, animal. He readied his bow, alerted to the strangeness.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Huntsman, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
I have found you wolf, says the huntsman. Your terrible deeds end here. 
The wolf protests once that he is an old Grandma, how dare he accuse of such.  The Huntsman points out all the clues, the and to double underline it, wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman.
The huntsman declares, "If you were human, I couldn't do this, but for the beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I've found you, wolf. Your deeds end here."

Whiskers twitched. The wolf purred, "Accusations? Poor Grandmother—aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom, hunter..."

The patchwork shifted; something long and warm moved beneath. The mantle clock kept its slow, indifferent tick.

He pinched the seam; a puff of flour rose and whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath and said, "Flour on the seams, whiskers against my hand, that sour fur-musk—Grandmother's spectacles on a snout."

The nightcap drooped; the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. He lifted the spectacles between forefinger and thumb, held them to the light. "That's no elder's profile—it's a muzzle."

He set the spectacles down slowly. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

The wolf's purr tightened.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Trim opening double image. Remove either "Night pooled in the corner;" or "The quilt swelled with something alive." Keep one strong image (prefer: "The quilt swelled with something alive.").

- Change "A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover." to something less blunt and more in-voice for the scene: e.g., "A white muzzle glinted at the quilt's edge." (keeps surprise, avoids repetition of 'beneath').

- Replace Huntsman's first line to match his low, economical cadence and make it less declarative/modern. Suggest: "I've found you, wolf. Your deeds end." (shorter, grimmer)

- Remove the adverbial "purred" for the Wolf's reply and let his cadence show his charm/menace. Rewrite his line to match his sly cadence and theatricality: e.g., "Accusations? Poor Grandmother—aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom, hunter." (keep but remove "The wolf purred," or change to a brief tag later: "the wolf said, silk over teeth.")

- The beat "The patchwork shifted; something long and warm moved beneath." repeats the earlier quilt-motion imagery. Delete or tighten to one concise beat: "The patchwork shifted; a long warmth moved under the seam."

- Cut passive "The mantle clock kept its slow, indifferent tick." Replace with a brief sensory beat tied to Huntsman's counting: "The mantle clock ticked; he counted it against his breath." (gives Huntsman agency and links to prior touch-points)

- Rework the flour/whiskers paragraph to avoid self-reporting actions awkwardly ("He pinched the seam; a puff of flour rose and whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath and said,"). Make it a single, tighter scene beat and then Huntsman's line. Suggested sequence:
  - "He pinched the seam. A puff of flour flared; whiskers rasped his finger. He smelled the sour fur-musk and said, 'Flour on the seams, whiskers against my hand—Grandmother's spectacles on a snout.'"
  (This removes narration telling he 'drew a breath' and keeps tactile detail.)

- The Huntsman's spoken clue-list is a bit long and rhetorical for his stoic style. Break it into two shorter statements or fragment the list with more hunterly nouns. Suggest: "'Flour on the seams. Whiskers on my skin. Fur-musk in the air. Those are no spectacles for an old woman.'"

- Remove the near-duplicate spectacle reveal lines. You have both "The nightcap drooped; the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout." and later "He lifted the spectacles... 'That's no elder's profile—it's a muzzle.'" Combine and tighten:
  - Action: "The nightcap drooped; the seam split. Spectacles slid free from a long snout."
  - Follow with Huntsman's calm observation: "'That's no elder's profile; it's a muzzle.'"

- Change "He set the spectacles down slowly." to something with Huntsman's tactile economy; e.g., "He laid them on the pillow, careful." (short, characterful)

- Soften or shift the final line to echo the touch-point and Huntsman's lexicon. Keep the judicial sentence but make it spare and in his voice. Suggest replacing current line with: "'If you were human, I couldn't. For beasts, I'm judge, jury, and executioner.'" (contraction removed to match cadence; but you may keep "I am" to sound colder: "'If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts, I am judge, jury, and executioner.'")

- Add one small Huntsman physical beat before his final line to ground the moment and emphasize decision (short, not theatrical). Insert: "He readied his bow, fingers finding the string." then deliver final line.

- Tone checks:
  - Ensure the Wolf's voice keeps sly, theatrical cadence and never admits intent. Keep any apparent pleading as performative. Remove any line where Wolf expresses genuine offense beyond manipulation ("how dare he accuse of such" reads modern/overblown) — prefer the suggested line above.
  - Ensure Huntsman's lines remain plain, tactile, and decisive; remove any florid verbs or excess explanation.

- Final pass: tighten to remove repeated references to quilt movement, whiskers, and spectacles. Keep one clear sequence: discovery (quilt bulge → muzzle glint), tactile proof (flour, whiskers, fur-musk), physical reveal (spectacles slide), verdict (Huntsman's calm identification and sentence).
