=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I've found you, wolf. Your deeds end here."

Whiskers twitched. The wolf purred, "Accusations? Poor Grandmother—aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom, hunter..."

The patchwork shifted; something long and warm moved beneath. The mantle clock kept its slow, indifferent tick.

He pinched the seam; a puff of flour rose and whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath and said, "Flour on the seams, whiskers against my hand, that sour fur-musk—Grandmother's spectacles on a snout."

The nightcap drooped; the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. He lifted the spectacles between forefinger and thumb, held them to the light. "That's no elder's profile—it's a muzzle."

He set the spectacles down slowly. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

The wolf's purr tightened.

---

The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; flour rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; Grandmother's nightcap and spectacles lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin, exposing the ruined eye. He lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones, drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman laid a steady palm on the wolf's belly and froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand's width to free the mattress, set the skinning knife to the seam, and cut, steady and economical.

A thin arm slipped through the rent—then Grandmother tumbled out first, pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and flour, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid out next, slick with wolf's blood and flour dust. The Huntsman covered her hair with a towel, guided her to a chair, wrapped another about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. He wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother's breath and pulse, then checked Red's pulse and breathing. The cottage slowly remembered itself.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Red, Grandmother, Huntsman

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
With the wolf dead, Grandmother and Red thank the huntsman. The huntsman says farewell.


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—there's enough forest in my rug already. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"Glad to help, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm, curtsied, and offered, "Please—take a bit of bread for the road," her eyes hopeful.

"No—keep it. You'll need it," he said. He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and stepped toward the door. "Latch the door at dusk. The night keeps its own counsel." He checked the path once more.

The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold. Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again.

"Take care." He tipped his cap and stepped onto the path.

Grandmother murmured, "Bless you," and smoothed Red's hood as the smell of bread and jam rose from the table.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove or tighten "Mind your boots—there's enough forest in my rug already." It reads jokey and undercuts the warm, frail tone. Replace with a short, homely caution: "Mind your boots, dear."

- Rework Grandmother's first block: drop "I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Keep one domestic action + a small sign of fatigue. Example: "Thank you, dear. I'll tend the stove and sit a spell." (Keeps voice, trims wordiness.)

- Make the huntsman's reply more in-character and economical. Replace "Glad to help, ma'am," with something quieter and woodsy: "Happy to be of service." (Short, plain, stoic.)

- Give Red one tiny physical beat before offering the bread to show nervous gratitude (clutching the basket or smoothing her hood). Then trim "her eyes hopeful" — show it instead with that gesture. Example: "Red clutched the basket, curtsied. 'Please—take a bit of bread for the road.'"

- Change the huntsman's "No—keep it. You'll need it," to one-line, matter-of-fact refusal plus a brief reason: "Keep it. You need it more." That keeps his pragmatic, protective tone and avoids repetition.

- Add one spare, huntsman-appropriate farewell line to fully realize the touch-point: after he tips his cap, have him say, plainly, "Stay to the path." or "Keep to the path, both of you." (Gives a protective finality and matches his voice.)

- Replace or trim the abstract sentence "The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold." Make it concrete and brief: "The clock ticked on as they shouldered the wolf." (Less poetic, clearer pacing.)

- Cut either "Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again." or pare it down to one image. Prefer: "Warmth pooled at the stove; the cottage seemed to breathe again." (Prevent redundancy and melodrama.)

- Swap "He checked the path once more." (passive/unclear) for a precise beat: "He glanced down the path, shoulders loose." (Shows readiness to leave.)

- Move Grandmother's "Bless you" to immediately follow the huntsman's final line or cap-tip to keep the farewell rhythm tight: have her murmur as he turns away rather than after he steps onto the path.

- Add a brief closing physical image to lock the scene and signal motion: show the huntsman's silhouette shrinking on the path or Red pressing the basket to her chest as the door closes. One small line will complete the exit and reinforce gratitude.

- Consistency check: ensure dialogue tags and narration avoid explaining emotions (e.g., delete "her eyes hopeful" and "his weight shifting" where gestures already show feeling). Use gestures not labels.

- Final pass: read aloud to tighten cadence—aim for short, tactile sentences for the Huntsman, soft, homely phrasing for Grandmother, and a small, earnest cadence for Red.
