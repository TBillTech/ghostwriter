You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised sweets and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow, while the sleek, flattering wolf slipped away along a deer-track to the cottage, reached it first, and with practiced calm swallowed Grandmother whole before setting the room into a careful masquerade; he powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, soothed the quilt and set the teapot whispering so the house would answer Red with the warmth of kin. Her knock and nursery hum were met by a voice too slick, a bed too round, the candle skewed into pooling shadows, and the quilt yawned to reveal whiskers and a paw; a scream was swallowed as warm dark folded around Red and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady, indifferent tick of the clock. A huntsman coming down the pine track heard a brief strangled sound, followed subtle prints and claw-marks to the sill, and slipped in with a low bow until the dim room answered him with sour fur-musk, powder on the pillow, and the odd rhythm of a breathing that was not age. He set his arrow, spoke the quiet accusation that makes beasts reveal themselves, and let the shaft fly through candle air and patchwork to bury in a single ruined eye; the beast shuddered, the borrowed garments fell askew, and under the rent of hide the true shapes spilled free—Grandmother coughing and blinking, Red slick with blood and flour dust—while the house, slow as sap, remembered how to be itself. The Huntsman tended cloth and pulse, laid towels and steadied hands, turned the clock’s stubborn tick into something gentler, and after a few exchanged courtesies and a warning to latch the door at dusk he shouldered his bow and left warmth pooling by the stove. Left to one another, Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set out bread and jam; I hung my red hood on a chair-back, the crust split with a village cut, buttered rounds and ladled the ruby jam as steam curled toward the rafters, and for a while the cottage held only the small, domestic rhythms of tea, crumbs, and a soft, reclaimed safety.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
With the wolf dead, Grandmother and Red thank the huntsman. The huntsman says farewell.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—you'll track the forest into my rug. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm and curtsied. "Please take a bit of bread for your road." She looked at him with hopeful eyes.

"Keep the basket. You need it," the huntsman said, and he nodded once.

"No need. I'll take care of the beast." He inclines his head, shoulders the bow, moves to the door.

"Latch the door at dusk," he added as he stepped toward the path. "The woods will be quieter for now, but mind the night." He checked the way with a quick look.

"You're a comfort to us, truly," Grandmother murmured, smiling. She breathed out, steadier now.

The room settled; the clock counted a quieter pace as the wolf was carried away. Warmth pooled by the stove as if the house remembered how to be itself.

"Take care of one another." The huntsman tipped his cap and stepped back onto the path.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Remove or trim "Mind your boots—you'll track the forest into my rug." It reads modern and clunky; replace with a shorter, homier line (e.g., "Mind your boots, dear—there's enough forest in my rug already.") or simply "Mind your boots."

- Change "I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am," to Huntsman-speech: make it shorter and more economical. Example: "Glad to help, ma'am." (Drop "I could be of service, ma'am"—too formal/long for him.)

- Combine Red's two sentences into one crisp beat to avoid small redundancy: replace
  "Red tucked the basket under her arm and curtsied. 'Please take a bit of bread for your road.' She looked at him with hopeful eyes."
  with
  "Red tucked the basket under her arm, curtsied and offered, 'Please—take a bit of bread for the road,' her eyes hopeful."
  (Keeps her cadence and saves space.)

- The huntsman's reply "Keep the basket. You need it," then the next two lines ("No need. I'll take care of the beast." "He inclines his head...") feel disjointed and ambiguous about speaker. Make speakers explicit and trim stilted phrasing:
  - Have Huntsman say one concise refusal: "No—keep it. You'll need it." 
  - Then compress action to a single tight beat: "He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and moved for the door."

- Remove/merge "He inclines his head, shoulders the bow, moves to the door." with following similar beats; choose one clear tense and stick to it (past tense throughout). Example: "He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and stepped toward the door."

- Rework the advisory line "Latch the door at dusk... mind the night." to sound like the Huntsman and less like exposition. Shorten to: "Latch your door at dusk. The woods are quiet for now, but not forever." Or, even briefer: "Latch the door at dusk. The night keeps its own counsel."

- Cut "He checked the way with a quick look." (redundant with stepping toward the path). If you want a beat, replace with "He checked the path once more."

- Remove the passive, slightly awkward sentence "The room settled; the clock counted a quieter pace as the wolf was carried away." Replace with a single sensory image: "The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold." (This keeps mood without abstract phrasing.)

- Replace "Warmth pooled by the stove as if the house remembered how to be itself." with a more domestic image in Grandmother's voice: e.g., "Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again." (Keeps lyricism but tighter.)

- Change the Huntsman's parting "Take care of one another." and tipping cap to a slightly more huntsman-like sendoff. Make it brief and deliberate: either leave as "Take care of one another," or compress: "Take care." Then give one small physical beat: "He tipped his cap and stepped onto the path."

- Add one brief action beat after the Huntsman leaves to ground Red and Grandmother's thanks without overwriting: for example, insert Grandmother's quiet "Bless you" or Red's murmured "Thank you, truly," followed by a small domestic gesture (Grandmother smoothing Red's hood or offering her a biscuit). Keep these to one short sentence to avoid slowing momentum.

- Check tense consistency: some lines use present ("He inclines") while most are past. Make all narration past tense.

- Trim redundancy in gratitude: there are three explicit thank-yous (Grandmother's opening thanks, "You're a comfort..." and later "thank you" implied). Reduce to two: Grandmother's initial thanks and a final, quiet "Thank you" from Red or Grandmother after Huntsman departs to close the scene.

- Maintain character voice constraints:
  - Ensure Grandmother's lines remain cozy and homey (use "dear," "bless you").
  - Keep Huntsman's lines short, plain, and pragmatic.
  - Keep Red's lines earnest, simple, and polite.

- Final pass: run for 1–2 tight sensory beats (a smell of warmed tea, the click of the latch, a towel on Red's shoulders) and remove any extra adjectives that don't advance mood or action.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.

The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold. Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again.

"Take care." He tipped his cap and stepped onto the path.

Grandmother murmured, "Bless you," and smoothed Red's hood as the smell of bread and jam rose from the table.
