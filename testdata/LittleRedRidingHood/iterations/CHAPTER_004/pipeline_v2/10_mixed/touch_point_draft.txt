Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—there's enough forest in my rug already. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"Glad to help, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm, curtsied, and offered, "Please—take a bit of bread for the road," her eyes hopeful.

"No—keep it. You'll need it," he said. He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and stepped toward the door. "Latch the door at dusk. The night keeps its own counsel." He checked the path once more.

The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold. Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again.

"Take care." He tipped his cap and stepped onto the path.

Grandmother murmured, "Bless you," and smoothed Red's hood as the smell of bread and jam rose from the table.
