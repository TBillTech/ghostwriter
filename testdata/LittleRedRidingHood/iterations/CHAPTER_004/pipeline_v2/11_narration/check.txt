You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; flour rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; Grandmother's nightcap and spectacles lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin, exposing the ruined eye. He lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones, drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman laid a steady palm on the wolf's belly and froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand's width to free the mattress, set the skinning knife to the seam, and cut, steady and economical.

A thin arm slipped through the rent—then Grandmother tumbled out first, pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and flour, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid out next, slick with wolf's blood and flour dust. The Huntsman covered her hair with a towel, guided her to a chair, wrapped another about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. He wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother's breath and pulse, then checked Red's pulse and breathing. The cottage slowly remembered itself.

---

Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—there's enough forest in my rug already. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"Glad to help, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm, curtsied, and offered, "Please—take a bit of bread for the road," her eyes hopeful.

"No—keep it. You'll need it," he said. He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and stepped toward the door. "Latch the door at dusk. The night keeps its own counsel." He checked the path once more.

The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold. Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again.

"Take care." He tipped his cap and stepped onto the path.

Grandmother murmured, "Bless you," and smoothed Red's hood as the smell of bread and jam rose from the table.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Grandmother, Huntsman

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
Grandmother and Red have tea, bread and jam.  The End.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Red steps inside and hangs her red hood over the chair-back; Red's hood catches the late light and warms the chair. Red sets the basket of goodies on the table and watches Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as the house settles around them. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

"I brought bread and jam, Grandmother," Red says, clutching the basket and curtsying.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answers, smiling.

Red lifts the lid of the basket and takes out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. She slices two rounds, crumbs falling neat on the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam and spreads it thick and glossy. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. They lift the cups together and steam curls around their noses, drifting up toward the rafters.

"These will warm you, Grandmother," Red says.

They eat the bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of their small motions. Before dusk fully fell, Red checked the latch once more, remembering the Huntsman's warning to latch the door at dusk.

"Stay a while, dear," Grandmother says.

Dusk leaned on the window until the day closed over the cottage; the clock's steady beat softened, and the house kept its small, reclaimed warmth.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Replace the ambiguous sentence "They eat the bread and jam;" with a named subject: "Red and Grandmother eat the bread and jam;" to remove pronoun vagueness.

- Change "the lid of the basket" (baskets rarely have lids) to a clearer, tactile image: e.g., "lifts the cloth from the basket" or "lifts the basket's cover" so object detail feels natural.

- Replace "the blade smooths the bread's face" with a simpler, less odd simile that keeps the writer's voice—suggestion: "the blade smooths the loaf's surface" to avoid distracting phrasing.

- Make the Huntsman reference explicit: change "remembering the Huntsman's warning to latch the door at dusk" to "remembering the Huntsman’s warning—Red checked the latch once more" so the subject of the action is clear and the warning is tied directly to Red.

- Streamline the closing so the touch-point reads unmistakably as an ending. Replace the last two sentences with a single, tidy closing that keeps the cozy tone and confirms the scene ended: e.g., "They finished their tea and the cottage kept its small, reclaimed warmth." (This makes the ending feel rounded without adding new plot elements.)

- Minor trim: remove small redundancies to tighten rhythm—suggest deleting "the table takes the gentle thrum of their small motions" or rephrase to "the table took the gentle thrum of their motions" to avoid repetition of "small."

- Optional flavor boost (keep writer's quirks): add one brief sensory line to deepen the tea moment without derailing the scene—e.g., after "steam curls..." insert "The jam's sweet-sour scent mixed with the tannin of tea"—if you want a stronger sensory anchor before the closing.
