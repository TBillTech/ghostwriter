You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised sweets and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow, while the sleek, flattering wolf slipped away along a deer-track to the cottage, reached it first, and with practiced calm swallowed Grandmother whole before setting the room into a careful masquerade; he powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, soothed the quilt and set the teapot whispering so the house would answer Red with the warmth of kin. Her knock and nursery hum were met by a voice too slick, a bed too round, the candle skewed into pooling shadows, and the quilt yawned to reveal whiskers and a paw; a scream was swallowed as warm dark folded around Red and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady, indifferent tick of the clock. A huntsman coming down the pine track heard a brief strangled sound, followed subtle prints and claw-marks to the sill, and slipped in with a low bow until the dim room answered him with sour fur-musk, powder on the pillow, and the odd rhythm of a breathing that was not age. He set his arrow, spoke the quiet accusation that makes beasts reveal themselves, and let the shaft fly through candle air and patchwork to bury in a single ruined eye; the beast shuddered, the borrowed garments fell askew, and under the rent of hide the true shapes spilled free—Grandmother coughing and blinking, Red slick with blood and flour dust—while the house, slow as sap, remembered how to be itself. The Huntsman tended cloth and pulse, laid towels and steadied hands, turned the clock’s stubborn tick into something gentler, and after a few exchanged courtesies and a warning to latch the door at dusk he shouldered his bow and left warmth pooling by the stove. Left to one another, Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set out bread and jam; I hung my red hood on a chair-back, the crust split with a village cut, buttered rounds and ladled the ruby jam as steam curled toward the rafters, and for a while the cottage held only the small, domestic rhythms of tea, crumbs, and a soft, reclaimed safety.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
Grandmother and Red have tea, bread and jam.  The End.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
I step inside and hang my red hood over the chair-back; the hood catches the late light and warms the chair. I set the basket of goodies on the table and watch Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as the house settles around us. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

"I brought bread and jam, Grandmother," I say, clutching the basket and curtsying.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answers, smiling.

I lift the lid of the basket and take out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. I slice two rounds, crumbs falling in a neat trail across the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam; the spoon glints and rests in the ruby shine, and the jam spreads thick and glossy. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. Grandmother and I lift the cups and steam curls around our noses, drifting up toward the rafters. Grandmother and I eat bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of our small motions. Before the light goes, I check the latch one last time; I remember the Huntsman's warning: "Latch the door at dusk." Dusk leans on the window until the day closes over the cottage.

"Stay a while, dear," Grandmother says.

Grandmother and I have tea, bread, and jam.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace first-person "I" with "Red" in at least the opening sentence (or consistently use "Red") to avoid pronoun ambiguity and fit the provided character list.
- Remove the repeated sentence "Grandmother and I have tea, bread, and jam." Instead end with a single, more lyrical closing line that signals finality (e.g., a brief restful image or the clock’s beat slowing) so the touch-point is honored without blunt repetition.
- Recast the Huntsman quote as a remembered warning rather than an on-the-spot quotation (e.g., "I remembered the Huntsman's warning to latch the door at dusk") to avoid implying he is present and to keep dialogue limited to allowed speakers.
- Vary the repeated phrase "Grandmother and I" (occurs three times) by swapping in small actions or details (e.g., "Grandmother pours tea while I slice," "we lift the cups together") to reduce redundancy and maintain the light, earnest cadence.
- Fix a small pronoun/antecedent awkwardness: in "the hood catches the late light and warms the chair," specify subject as Red’s hood (e.g., "Red's hood") or rephrase to keep clarity.
- Tighten sensory details that verge on clutter: choose one strong image for the jam/tea moment (either the spoon glinting in the jam or the steam curling) rather than listing both in adjacent sentences—this preserves the writer’s quirky metaphors while improving focus.
- Soften the "Before the light goes" line for tense consistency and rhythm (e.g., "Before dusk fully fell, I checked the latch once more") to match the present-past mix and keep the scene calm.
- Small character-voice touch: add one brief, simple Red line of dialogue (polite and earnest) during the meal—this will keep her cadence present and avoid passive narration (e.g., "These will warm you, Grandmother," or "Does the jam taste welcome?").
- Consider trimming the extra housekeeping detail "crumbs falling in a neat trail across the board" to "crumbs falling neat on the board" to keep sentences economical while preserving charming specificity.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.

=== RESPONSE ===
Red steps inside and hangs her red hood over the chair-back; Red's hood catches the late light and warms the chair. Red sets the basket of goodies on the table and watches Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as the house settles around them. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

"I brought bread and jam, Grandmother," Red says, clutching the basket and curtsying.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answers, smiling.

Red lifts the lid of the basket and takes out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. She slices two rounds, crumbs falling neat on the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam and spreads it thick and glossy. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. They lift the cups together and steam curls around their noses, drifting up toward the rafters.

"These will warm you, Grandmother," Red says.

They eat the bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of their small motions. Before dusk fully fell, Red checked the latch once more, remembering the Huntsman's warning to latch the door at dusk.

"Stay a while, dear," Grandmother says.

Dusk leaned on the window until the day closed over the cottage; the clock's steady beat softened, and the house kept its small, reclaimed warmth.
