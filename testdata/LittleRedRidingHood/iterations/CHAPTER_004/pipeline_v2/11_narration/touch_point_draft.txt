Red steps inside and hangs her red hood over the chair-back; Red's hood catches the late light and warms the chair. Red sets the basket of goodies on the table and watches Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as the house settles around them. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

"I brought bread and jam, Grandmother," Red says, clutching the basket and curtsying.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answers, smiling.

Red lifts the lid of the basket and takes out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. She slices two rounds, crumbs falling neat on the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam and spreads it thick and glossy. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. They lift the cups together and steam curls around their noses, drifting up toward the rafters.

"These will warm you, Grandmother," Red says.

They eat the bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of their small motions. Before dusk fully fell, Red checked the latch once more, remembering the Huntsman's warning to latch the door at dusk.

"Stay a while, dear," Grandmother says.

Dusk leaned on the window until the day closed over the cottage; the clock's steady beat softened, and the house kept its small, reclaimed warmth.
