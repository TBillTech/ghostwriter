You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised sweets and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow, while the sleek, flattering wolf slipped away along a deer-track to the cottage, reached it first, and with practiced calm swallowed Grandmother whole before setting the room into a careful masquerade; he powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, soothed the quilt and set the teapot whispering so the house would answer Red with the warmth of kin. Her knock and nursery hum were met by a voice too slick, a bed too round, the candle skewed into pooling shadows, and the quilt yawned to reveal whiskers and a paw; a scream was swallowed as warm dark folded around Red and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady, indifferent tick of the clock. A huntsman coming down the pine track heard a brief strangled sound, followed subtle prints and claw-marks to the sill, and slipped in with a low bow until the dim room answered him with sour fur-musk, powder on the pillow, and the odd rhythm of a breathing that was not age. He set his arrow, spoke the quiet accusation that makes beasts reveal themselves, and let the shaft fly through candle air and patchwork to bury in a single ruined eye; the beast shuddered, the borrowed garments fell askew, and under the rent of hide the true shapes spilled free—Grandmother coughing and blinking, Red slick with blood and flour dust—while the house, slow as sap, remembered how to be itself. The Huntsman tended cloth and pulse, laid towels and steadied hands, turned the clock’s stubborn tick into something gentler, and after a few exchanged courtesies and a warning to latch the door at dusk he shouldered his bow and left warmth pooling by the stove. Left to one another, Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set out bread and jam; I hung my red hood on a chair-back, the crust split with a village cut, buttered rounds and ladled the ruby jam as steam curled toward the rafters, and for a while the cottage held only the small, domestic rhythms of tea, crumbs, and a soft, reclaimed safety.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:


# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The Huntsman fires the arrow, and it flys true. Wolf slumps dead in the bed, with an arrow in the eye. 
The huntsman notices the moving belly of Wolf, and partly in shock, party in fascination, cuts wolf's belly open with his skinning knife. 
First Grandmother spills out—pale, blinking, shocked with breath and alive. Then Red, slick with Wolf’s remains.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf, burying itself in the wolf's eye. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; powder rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; the borrowed garments lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin and the ruin of the eye, confirming the kill, then lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones. He laid a steady palm on the mound to feel life within. He froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand’s width to free the mattress and drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman set the skinning knife's edge at the soft seam, then cut with the steady, practiced hand of a hunter.

The mound slackened and shifted; something small worked forward through the rent. Grandmother spilled out first—pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and powder, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid free next, slick with the wolf’s blood and flour dust; the Huntsman set a towel over her hair and face, guided her to the chair, wrapped another towel about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. The Huntsman wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother’s breath and pulse, checked Red’s, and the cottage began, very slowly, to remember how to be a house again.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace vague nouns with names to remove ambiguity: e.g., change "He laid a steady palm on the mound" → "The Huntsman laid a steady palm on the wolf's belly" (or "on the quilted mound covering the wolf's belly") so it's clear whose body/mound is meant.

- Make the arrow-in-eye impact explicit and final: emphasize death in same sentence as the shot (e.g., "the arrow struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead") so the kill reads unequivocally and matches the touch-point.

- Clarify which garments belong to whom: replace "the borrowed garments lay askew" with "Grandmother's nightcap and spectacles lay askew" (or "the wolf's borrowed nightgown lay askew") to avoid reader confusion about who wore what.

- Fix mixed imagery of "powder" vs "flour": pick one term and use it consistently (the prior touch-points use "flour"; prefer "flour dust" here). Change all instances of "powder" to "flour" if that is the intended detail.

- Remove passive/indirect phrasing where it blunts the sequence: change "The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin and the ruin of the eye" → "The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin, exposing the ruined eye" for tighter clarity.

- Reorder minor actions for logical flow: draw the basin and lay towels before rolling the body (or state clearly why he rolls first). For example: "He set the bow against the hearthstones, drew a basin and laid towels on the stool, then rolled the body a hand's width to free the mattress."

- Make the Huntsman's procedure language match his character (spare, technical): replace "set the skinning knife's edge at the soft seam, then cut with the steady, practiced hand of a hunter" → "He set the skinning knife to the seam and cut, steady and economical." (Keeps hunter cadence, removes florid phrasing.)

- Replace "something small worked forward through the rent" with a clearer but still slightly strange image: "A thin arm slipped through the rent—then Grandmother tumbled out" (this preserves surprise but names first emergent actor to reduce ambiguity).

- State discovery sequence explicitly and starkly: ensure sentence order reads: arrow hits → wolf slumps dead → Huntsman notices moving belly → Huntsman cuts belly → Grandmother emerges → Red emerges. Consider condensing into a tightened paragraph so the reader cannot mis-order events.

- Clarify Red's condition and handling more concretely: change "Red, slick with the wolf’s blood and flour dust; the Huntsman set a towel over her hair and face..." → "Red slid out next, slick with wolf's blood and flour dust. The Huntsman covered her hair with a towel, guided her to a chair, wrapped another about her shoulders, and steadied her feet." (Make actions discrete and subject clear.)

- Make medical checks explicit: replace "checked Grandmother’s breath and pulse, checked Red’s" → "checked Grandmother's breath and pulse, then checked Red's pulse and breathing" to remove trailing ambiguity.

- Tighten or remove mild repetition: consider cutting "the cottage began, very slowly, to remember how to be a house again" or make it more concise to preserve the eerie tone without diluting the surgical moment (e.g., "the cottage slowly remembered itself").

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.
