You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I've found you, wolf. Your deeds end here."

Whiskers twitched. The wolf purred, "Accusations? Poor Grandmother—aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom, hunter..."

The patchwork shifted; something long and warm moved beneath. The mantle clock kept its slow, indifferent tick.

He pinched the seam; a puff of flour rose and whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath and said, "Flour on the seams, whiskers against my hand, that sour fur-musk—Grandmother's spectacles on a snout."

The nightcap drooped; the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. He lifted the spectacles between forefinger and thumb, held them to the light. "That's no elder's profile—it's a muzzle."

He set the spectacles down slowly. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

The wolf's purr tightened.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Huntsman, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
The Huntsman fires the arrow, and it flys true. Wolf slumps dead in the bed, with an arrow in the eye. 
The huntsman notices the moving belly of Wolf, and partly in shock, party in fascination, cuts wolf's belly open with his skinning knife. 
First Grandmother spills out—pale, blinking, shocked with breath and alive. Then Red, slick with Wolf’s remains.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; flour rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; Grandmother's nightcap and spectacles lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin, exposing the ruined eye. He lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones, drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman laid a steady palm on the wolf's belly and froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand's width to free the mattress, set the skinning knife to the seam, and cut, steady and economical.

A thin arm slipped through the rent—then Grandmother tumbled out first, pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and flour, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid out next, slick with wolf's blood and flour dust. The Huntsman covered her hair with a towel, guided her to a chair, wrapped another about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. He wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother's breath and pulse, then checked Red's pulse and breathing. The cottage slowly remembered itself.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Make the arrow’s impact unmistakable and tied to the eye: change any vague verb (“struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead”) to a single crisp image: arrow buried in the eye socket, shaft tilted. (Keeps immediacy of the kill.)

- Remove the duplicate spectacle/ nightcap images or combine them into one tight sentence so the paragraph doesn’t stall on the same detail twice.

- Clarify source of the “herb-sour breath”: explicitly attribute it to the wolf (e.g., “the wolf’s herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth”) to avoid pronoun ambiguity.

- Strengthen the Huntsman’s internal beat when he feels the moving belly: add one short, precise line that names his reaction as both shock and clinical curiosity (e.g., “He felt it move, and for a moment his hands were two trades: hunter’s duty and a surgeon’s curiosity.”). Keep it understated to match his cadence.

- Tighten the cutting action: make the sequence mechanical and economical—roll the body, find the seam, set the skinning knife, cut—remove any extra beats that dilute momentum between knife and reveal.

- Make the reveal verbs sharper and consistent with tone: replace “tumbled out first” with “spilled out first” or “fell out first” for Grandmother; replace “Red slid out next” with “Red emerged next” or “Red tumbled free” to preserve the shocking, messy image.

- Preserve the shock of Red’s condition by inserting one compact sensory line about her appearance that keeps the writer’s voice but clarifies cause: “Red emerged slick with wolf’s blood and dusted in pale flour.” (Avoid “slick with Wolf’s remains,” which is vague/metaphorical.)

- Show the Huntsman’s practical aftercare with a single crisp sentence that orders actions clearly (towel to Red’s hair, guide to chair, wrap the shoulders, check pulses)—avoid repeating “checked” or passive language.

- Tighten final line to show recovery and the room’s recalibration in one evocative, active sentence (e.g., “The cottage slowly remembered itself: hearth warming, clock ticking, breaths returning.”) —don’t leave it vague.

- Minor wording: change “laid towels on the stool” to “laid towels on the stool beside him” (spatial clarity), and change “set the skinning knife to the seam” to “set the skinning knife to the seam and cut” (removes a pause).

- Watch pronouns at paragraph starts (e.g., “The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin” is fine; ensure subsequent sentences use names when ambiguity might arise—keep using “The Huntsman,” “Grandmother,” “Red,” “the wolf” rather than “he/they”).

- Optional stylistic note: keep the writer’s quirky flourishes (flour-as-ash, herb-sour breath), but trim any image that repeats the same sensory register twice in a row (visual → visual → visual); intersperse one tactile or olfactory beat to maintain balance.
