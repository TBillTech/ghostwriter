The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; flour rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; Grandmother's nightcap and spectacles lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin, exposing the ruined eye. He lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones, drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman laid a steady palm on the wolf's belly and froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand's width to free the mattress, set the skinning knife to the seam, and cut, steady and economical.

A thin arm slipped through the rent—then Grandmother tumbled out first, pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and flour, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid out next, slick with wolf's blood and flour dust. The Huntsman covered her hair with a towel, guided her to a chair, wrapped another about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. He wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother's breath and pulse, then checked Red's pulse and breathing. The cottage slowly remembered itself.
