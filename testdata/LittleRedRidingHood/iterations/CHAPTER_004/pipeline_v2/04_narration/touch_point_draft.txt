A hundred yards out the huntsman heard Red's brief, strangled cry, cut then muffled by the pines. He left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He tracked fat wolf pads and claw marks straight to the sill; they did not lead away.

The huntsman circled the cottage once. He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees. He paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered. Its steady tick measured a calm that was forced.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door close soundlessly. Floorboards showed no scuffle. The table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was cold; a ring of condensed steam rimmed the lid. The fire had died to grey. The air told him—fur-musk, flour dust, hearth ash. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed.

Grandmother's quilt bulged—an extra-round mound, too full for an old woman's frame. Grandmother's spectacles glinted on the bolster; powder dented the pillow. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it was long-muzzled. The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age.

His eyes swept rafters, corners, the shadow under the bed. He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drew. Breathe. Count. The mound moved. The scent changed—close, warm, animal. He readied his bow, alerted to the strangeness.
