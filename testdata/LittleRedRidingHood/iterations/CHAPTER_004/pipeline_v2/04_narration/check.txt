You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Huntsman

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
He circles once, listens again, and slips inside. The quiet feels manufactured, the air thick with fur-musk and flour dust. His eye takes in the neat room, the undisturbed table, the bed with its extra-round quilt. He readies his bow, alerted to the strangeness.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
A hundred yards out the huntsman heard Red's brief, strangled cry, cut then muffled by the pines. He left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He tracked fat wolf pads and claw marks straight to the sill; they did not lead away.

The huntsman circled the cottage once. He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees. He paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered. Its steady tick measured a calm that was forced.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door close soundlessly. Floorboards showed no scuffle. The table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was cold; a ring of condensed steam rimmed the lid. The fire had died to grey. The air told him—fur-musk, flour dust, hearth ash. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed.

Grandmother's quilt bulged—an extra-round mound, too full for an old woman's frame. Grandmother's spectacles glinted on the bolster; powder dented the pillow. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it was long-muzzled. The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age.

His eyes swept rafters, corners, the shadow under the bed. He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drew. Breathe. Count. The mound moved. The scent changed—close, warm, animal. He readied his bow, alerted to the strangeness.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove the duplicate beat about readying the bow. Keep one clear moment of preparation (preferably the final line). Delete either the sentence ending "He readied his bow, alerted to the strangeness." in the penultimate paragraph or the identical final sentence; keep the stronger placement.

- Replace "a ring of condensed steam rimmed the lid" with a clearer, tactile image tied to the setting (e.g., "a ring of condensation rimmed the lid" or "a rim of stale steam and dust marked the lid") so it reads physically plausible.

- Change "Floorboards showed no scuffle." to a more precise hunting detail that fits the Huntsman's lexicon (e.g., "Floorboards bore no scuff," "No scuff marks crossed the boards," or "The boards showed no sign of a struggle").

- Make the flour detail explicit where it matters: replace the vague "powder dented the pillow" with "flour dented the pillow" to connect to the factoid and clarify the smell described earlier.

- Tidy the clock/listening sequence to avoid redundancy: combine "He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees." into one tight line that emphasizes the Huntsman's sensory checklist (e.g., "He listened, counted the clock’s stubborn ticks, and felt the roof settle under the trees.").

- Soften or clarify "The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age."—make the contrast crisper and more hunting-focused (e.g., "The mound rose and fell, but the rhythm wasn't the shallow, ragged inhale of age; it was deeper, animal.").

- Replace "the outline beneath it was long-muzzled" with a phrasing that preserves the writer's voice but is less awkward grammatically (e.g., "the shape beneath it read long-muzzled" or "the outline under the cap was long-muzzled").

- Strengthen Huntsman-specific sensory language in one or two places: swap a generic word or phrase (like "scent changed—close, warm, animal") for a leaner, hunted-ground phrasing (e.g., "the scent sharpened: close and warm—wolf.") to honor the Huntsman's lexicon and cadence.

- Minor tightening: consider collapsing some short staccato sentences into pairs for rhythm (e.g., "Nocked. Drew. Breathe. Count." → "Nocked and drawn; breathe. Count.") only if it preserves the deliberate cadence; otherwise keep as-is.

- Confirm pronoun clarity: ensure every "He" in each paragraph clearly refers to the Huntsman (no changes needed if kept in this scene), but change any later sentences that might ambiguously refer to another subject.
