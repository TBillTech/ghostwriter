A hundred yards out he heard Red's brief, strangled cry, cut then muffled by the pines. He left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He followed wide pads and claw marks pressed into the damp, pine-scented earth—wolf spoor, pads and claw marks that ran fat and straight to the sill and did not lead away.

He circled the cottage once. He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees. He paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered. Its steady tick measured a calm that was forced.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door fall without a sound. Floorboards showed no scuffle. The table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was no longer warm; a ring of cooled steam rimmed the lid. The fire had died to grey. The air inside told him things: sour fur-musk, flour dust, ash by the hearth. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed.

The bed’s quilt bulged extra-round, a mound too full for a single elder’s frame. Spectacles glinted on the bolster, powder on the pillow. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it was long-muzzled. The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age.

His eyes swept rafters, corners, the shadow under the bed. He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drove the bow up. Steady. The mound moved. The beast smelled him.

Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here."

Whiskers twitching, the wolf purred, "Such accusations. Grandmother is all aches and coughs; mind your tone in a sickroom."

The bed exhaled; the patchwork hid a predator's line. The clock ticked, counting down to the draw.

The huntsman stepped closer, eyes narrowed. "Tracks run fat and straight to this door. They don't leave." He pinched the seam between thumb and forefinger; a puff of flour rose and the whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath; a sour fur-musk threaded with flour dust rose to his nostrils. "Tracks, the sour musk, spectacles perched on a snout."

The wolf's voice went honeyed. "You mistake frailty for brutality, hunter. Come closer—see how feeble she is."

The nightcap drooped; a long brow showed through the patchwork. The quilt twitched and the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf, burying itself in the wolf's eye. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; powder rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; the borrowed garments lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin and the ruin of the eye, confirming the kill, then lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones. He laid a steady palm on the mound to feel life within. He froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand’s width to free the mattress and drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman set the skinning knife's edge at the soft seam, then cut with the steady, practiced hand of a hunter.

The mound slackened and shifted; something small worked forward through the rent. Grandmother spilled out first—pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and powder, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid free next, slick with the wolf’s blood and flour dust; the Huntsman set a towel over her hair and face, guided her to the chair, wrapped another towel about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. The Huntsman wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother’s breath and pulse, checked Red’s, and the cottage began, very slowly, to remember how to be a house again.

Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—you'll track the forest into my rug. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm and curtsied. "Please take a bit of bread for your road." She looked at him with hopeful eyes.

"Keep the basket. You need it," the huntsman said, and he nodded once.

"No need. I'll take care of the beast." He inclines his head, shoulders the bow, moves to the door.

"Latch the door at dusk," he added as he stepped toward the path. "The woods will be quieter for now, but mind the night." He checked the way with a quick look.

"You're a comfort to us, truly," Grandmother murmured, smiling. She breathed out, steadier now.

The room settled; the clock counted a quieter pace as the wolf was carried away. Warmth pooled by the stove as if the house remembered how to be itself.

"Take care of one another." The huntsman tipped his cap and stepped back onto the path.

Grandmother and Red have tea, bread and jam.  The End.

I step inside and hang my red hood over the chair-back; the hood catches the late light and warms the chair. I set the basket of goodies on the table and watch Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as the house settles around us. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

"I brought bread and jam, Grandmother," I say, clutching the basket and curtsying.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answers, smiling.

I lift the lid of the basket and take out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. I slice two rounds, crumbs falling in a neat trail across the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam; the spoon glints and rests in the ruby shine, and the jam spreads thick and glossy. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. Grandmother and I lift the cups and steam curls around our noses, drifting up toward the rafters. Grandmother and I eat bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of our small motions. Before the light goes, I check the latch one last time; I remember the Huntsman's warning: "Latch the door at dusk." Dusk leans on the window until the day closes over the cottage.

"Stay a while, dear," Grandmother says.

Grandmother and I have tea, bread, and jam.
