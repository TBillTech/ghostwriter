Red had promised sweets and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow, while the sleek, flattering wolf slipped away along a deer-track to the cottage, reached it first, and with practiced calm swallowed Grandmother whole before setting the room into a careful masquerade; he powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, soothed the quilt and set the teapot whispering so the house would answer Red with the warmth of kin. Her knock and nursery hum were met by a voice too slick, a bed too round, the candle skewed into pooling shadows, and the quilt yawned to reveal whiskers and a paw; a scream was swallowed as warm dark folded around Red and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady, indifferent tick of the clock. A huntsman coming down the pine track heard a brief strangled sound, left the ribbon of trail, tracked heavy pads and clawed edges to the sill, and circled the cottage until the forced calm of the teapot and neat table told him something in the room breathed wrong. He slipped in with bow low, tested the jamb, read the air—fur-musk, flour dust, hearth-ash—and found the quilt bulging with a muzzle and a purr where an old woman's chest should be; his fingers brushed flour and whiskers, his quiet accusation pulled taut, and an arrow hummed through candle air to bury in a single ruined eye. The beast shuddered and let loose its stolen garments; flour puffed like ash, spectacles tipped, a nightcap fell away, and from the rent Grandmother tumbled out coughing and blinking while Red slipped free, slick with blood and dust; the huntsman turned the ruined calm into towels and basin, pressed steady palms to wounds, and brought the cottage back to itself. Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set out bread and jam; Red hung her hood on the chair-back, split the crust with a village cut, and they let the small, domestic rhythms—tea, crumbs, a softened clock—reclaim the room, while the huntsman, warned and wary, shouldered his bow and left them to latch the door at dusk and keep the night at bay.
