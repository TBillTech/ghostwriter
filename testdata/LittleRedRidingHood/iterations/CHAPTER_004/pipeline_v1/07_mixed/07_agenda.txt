=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
I have found you wolf, says the huntsman. Your terrible deeds end here. 
The wolf protests once that he is an old Grandma, how dare he accuse of such.  The Huntsman points out all the clues, the and to double underline it, wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman.
The huntsman declares, "If you were human, I couldn't do this, but for the beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
Narrator: You see the bed bellow slow, the quilt mounded like a harvest sack; nightcap cocked, spectacles fogged, a powder-white muzzle just peeking.

huntsman: You say, "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here," and you let the bow rise with a quiet draw.

wolf: You purr, "Wolf? Grandmama is all aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom," voice thin as old tea.

Narrator: You hear the clock tick stubborn, ash slumping on the grate, and sour musk riding under flour-dust and thyme.

huntsman: You state, "Tracks run fat and straight to this door," and you note, "None leaving."

Narrator: You keep the bow low until the thought of a shot steadies; then you bring it level and let your eyes sweep rafters, corners, underbed shadow.

wolf: You murmur, "Such accusations," smoothing the quilt with a practiced hand, "would you point arrows at a frail old woman?"

Narrator: You watch the mound lift and settle in a rhythm too strong for age; whiskered lips curve with a lazy satisfaction.

huntsman: You say, "That smell is wolf, and fresh," and you add the specifics—"Powder wiped on whiskers. Spectacles riding a snout."

Narrator: You take two careful steps right, angling past the dresser glass; you find a clear line through patchwork seams.

wolf: You feign hurt and say, "You mistake a grandmother’s poor nose for… brutishness. Come nearer; you’ll see."

Narrator: You notice the nightcap droop; it can’t hide the long brow; the quilt twitches when the bowstring whispers.

huntsman: You tell them, "Old women don’t wear muzzles," and you underline it, "And they don’t leave claw marks in damp earth."

Narrator: You note the sewing kit tin by the bedside, basin and towels at the ready; your gaze flicks, counts, and returns.

wolf: You soften your voice and say, "Cruel man. Set that thing down. You’ll wake the child."

Narrator: You let a beat of silence hang; you measure breath to breath, and the house holds its own.

huntsman: You say, low and even, "If you were human, I couldn’t do this. For beasts of the forest, you are judged—by me, jury and executioner."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
huntsman:
* You have found the quarry after patient tracking; the discovery validates your purpose and sharpens your resolve.
* You speak to end harm; you believe stopping the beast protects the vulnerable and restores order.
* You want a clear, uncontestable outcome: confession or cessation. Your immediate aim is to neutralize the threat.
* You want evidence acknowledged aloud; naming spoor and signs forces truth into the room and denies excuses.
* You are performing the office of law in the woods: impartial, measured, and final when necessary.
* You hide a personal satisfaction in the capture—professional pride—not cruelty; you will not admit that satisfaction openly.
* Your mood is calm and inexorable; each sentence trims options for the other until only surrender or consequence remain.
* You rely on plain, unornamented speech to corral deceit and to deny the other any rhetoric that might loosen your grip.
* You aim to maintain control of timing and tone so witnesses (real or moral) register the judgment as inevitable.
* Underneath your steadiness is a sense of duty that brooks no sentimental exceptions, even if the target pleads play-acting.

wolf:
* You prefer persuasion to force; your words are an attempt to redirect suspicion and buy time.
* You care because exposure means losing freedom and appetite; you will manipulate pity to fracture resolve.
* You want to appear frail and human enough to sow doubt, to convert accusation into a misunderstanding.
* You seek to sow confusion—soften accusations, question perceptions, and suggest error so the huntsman hesitates.
* You hide your predatory intent beneath rehearsed voices of pain and inconvenience; your true need (escape, opportunity) is concealed.
* Your mood is performative calm edged with hunger; you mix wounded tones and small indignations to unsettle the listener.
* You exploit compliments and faux offense to turn scrutiny inward: if chastened, the pursuer may feel remorse.
* You watch for any softening, any moral crack you can lever into mercy; your language is crafted to open that seam.
* You will feign concern for bystanders to make the other doubt the righteousness of immediate violence.
* If the hunter's resolve hardens, you will pivot to sharper misdirection; until then you cling to theatrical civility as protection.
