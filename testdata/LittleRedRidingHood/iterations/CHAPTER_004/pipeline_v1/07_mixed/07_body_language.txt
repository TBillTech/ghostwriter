List body language cues as bullet points.

You are a Creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
You have already given each line that needs to be said to the actors, but the reader needs to know who is speaking.  Each line with the actor id followed by colon, needs to be converted to a brief narration point, describing who is about to say something, and possibly include some creative body language flavor. Try to channel the idea that "how you say it is more important than what you say". Another helpful idea is that imagine you are deaf, how would you describe what is happening? Ideally we want even a deaf bystander to be interested and wonder what is going on. Feel free to make it adversarial.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is the central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
I have found you wolf, says the huntsman. Your terrible deeds end here. 
The wolf protests once that he is an old Grandma, how dare he accuse of such.  The Huntsman points out all the clues, the and to double underline it, wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman.
The huntsman declares, "If you were human, I couldn't do this, but for the beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."


# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: The brief narration should definitely let the reader know who is speaking or going to speak.  
2. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
3. **Narration Voice**: Keep the narration in third person, past tense, active voice.  Describe the body language of the actor as if you were describing a play.
4. **Narrator**: If the line begins with "Narrator:", just copy the whole line over into the output.
5. **Stay Brief as Possible**: Keep the narrative as brief as possible. You should prefer one or two beats, never more than that. An incomplete sentence is necessary.  ALWAYS put EXACTLY ONE quoted string in the line, either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.
6. **Formatting**: Make sure to put a single bullet '*' character at the start of each line.
7. **Avoid**: Boring ultra common words for speaking.  For example, do NOT use the word "said".
8. **Prefer**: Do try to use color words like "mumbled", "muttered", "exclaimed", "yelled", "forced", "enunciated", "complained", "worried", "derided" etc.  This is not exhaustive.  Be creative. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 examples)

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points directly at the hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

## Examples of brief narration outputs (3 examples)

* Henry complained, "There's a hole in the bucket dear Liza, dear Liza ... "

* "Then fix it dear henry!", Liza exclaimed.

* Narrator: Liza points directly at the hold.

* Henry complained again, "With what shall I fix it dear Liza, dear Liza ... "

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one output bullet per actor line:
Narrator: You see the bed bellow slow, the quilt mounded like a harvest sack; nightcap cocked, spectacles fogged, a powder-white muzzle just peeking.

huntsman: You say, "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here," and you let the bow rise with a quiet draw.

wolf: You purr, "Wolf? Grandmama is all aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom," voice thin as old tea.

Narrator: You hear the clock tick stubborn, ash slumping on the grate, and sour musk riding under flour-dust and thyme.

huntsman: You state, "Tracks run fat and straight to this door," and you note, "None leaving."

Narrator: You keep the bow low until the thought of a shot steadies; then you bring it level and let your eyes sweep rafters, corners, underbed shadow.

wolf: You murmur, "Such accusations," smoothing the quilt with a practiced hand, "would you point arrows at a frail old woman?"

Narrator: You watch the mound lift and settle in a rhythm too strong for age; whiskered lips curve with a lazy satisfaction.

huntsman: You say, "That smell is wolf, and fresh," and you add the specifics—"Powder wiped on whiskers. Spectacles riding a snout."

Narrator: You take two careful steps right, angling past the dresser glass; you find a clear line through patchwork seams.

wolf: You feign hurt and say, "You mistake a grandmother’s poor nose for… brutishness. Come nearer; you’ll see."

Narrator: You notice the nightcap droop; it can’t hide the long brow; the quilt twitches when the bowstring whispers.

huntsman: You tell them, "Old women don’t wear muzzles," and you underline it, "And they don’t leave claw marks in damp earth."

Narrator: You note the sewing kit tin by the bedside, basin and towels at the ready; your gaze flicks, counts, and returns.

wolf: You soften your voice and say, "Cruel man. Set that thing down. You’ll wake the child."

Narrator: You let a beat of silence hang; you measure breath to breath, and the house holds its own.

huntsman: You say, low and even, "If you were human, I couldn’t do this. For beasts of the forest, you are judged—by me, jury and executioner."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line the actors say to brief third person identity narratives. Use 2 to 4 words aside from the quoted phrase, just a single simple phrase to identify the speaker. DO NOT make multiple parenthetical phrases. Feel free to add words to the quoted string if you feel like it.
