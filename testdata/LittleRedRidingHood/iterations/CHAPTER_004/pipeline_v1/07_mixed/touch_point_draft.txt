Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here."

Whiskers twitching, the wolf purred, "Such accusations. Grandmother is all aches and coughs; mind your tone in a sickroom."

The bed exhaled; the patchwork hid a predator's line. The clock ticked, counting down to the draw.

The huntsman stepped closer, eyes narrowed. "Tracks run fat and straight to this door. They don't leave." He pinched the seam between thumb and forefinger; a puff of flour rose and the whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath; a sour fur-musk threaded with flour dust rose to his nostrils. "Tracks, the sour musk, spectacles perched on a snout."

The wolf's voice went honeyed. "You mistake frailty for brutality, hunter. Come closer—see how feeble she is."

The nightcap drooped; a long brow showed through the patchwork. The quilt twitched and the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts, I am judge, jury, and executioner."
