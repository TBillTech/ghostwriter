=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
I have found you wolf, says the huntsman. Your terrible deeds end here. 
The wolf protests once that he is an old Grandma, how dare he accuse of such.  The Huntsman points out all the clues, the and to double underline it, wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman.
The huntsman declares, "If you were human, I couldn't do this, but for the beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
Narrator: You see the bed bellow slow, the quilt mounded like a harvest sack; nightcap cocked, spectacles fogged, a powder-white muzzle just peeking.

huntsman: You say, "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here," and you let the bow rise with a quiet draw.

wolf: You purr, "Wolf? Grandmama is all aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom," voice thin as old tea.

Narrator: You hear the clock tick stubborn, ash slumping on the grate, and sour musk riding under flour-dust and thyme.

huntsman: You state, "Tracks run fat and straight to this door," and you note, "None leaving."

Narrator: You keep the bow low until the thought of a shot steadies; then you bring it level and let your eyes sweep rafters, corners, underbed shadow.

wolf: You murmur, "Such accusations," smoothing the quilt with a practiced hand, "would you point arrows at a frail old woman?"

Narrator: You watch the mound lift and settle in a rhythm too strong for age; whiskered lips curve with a lazy satisfaction.

huntsman: You say, "That smell is wolf, and fresh," and you add the specifics—"Powder wiped on whiskers. Spectacles riding a snout."

Narrator: You take two careful steps right, angling past the dresser glass; you find a clear line through patchwork seams.

wolf: You feign hurt and say, "You mistake a grandmother’s poor nose for… brutishness. Come nearer; you’ll see."

Narrator: You notice the nightcap droop; it can’t hide the long brow; the quilt twitches when the bowstring whispers.

huntsman: You tell them, "Old women don’t wear muzzles," and you underline it, "And they don’t leave claw marks in damp earth."

Narrator: You note the sewing kit tin by the bedside, basin and towels at the ready; your gaze flicks, counts, and returns.

wolf: You soften your voice and say, "Cruel man. Set that thing down. You’ll wake the child."

Narrator: You let a beat of silence hang; you measure breath to breath, and the house holds its own.

huntsman: You say, low and even, "If you were human, I couldn’t do this. For beasts of the forest, you are judged—by me, jury and executioner."

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
Narrator: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
huntsman: You feel the bed’s shape and the fogged spectacles sharpen the task at hand; the image steels your draw as you tell the beast its deeds end.
wolf: You bristle at being named, feeling the bow’s promise in the room, and you smooth your manner into brittle infirmity to answer the charge.
Narrator: You note the clock and the sour musk as confirmation, and you let the rhythm of the house press on whatever truth the wolf tries to wear.
huntsman: You take the clock’s stubborn ticking as proof of presence and think in tracks and timing; the claim about fat straight runs tightens your aim.
Narrator: You feel the measured ritual of the hunter—bow held low, eyes sweeping—settle the room into a series of holes where lies might hide.
wolf: You register the sweep of those eyes as a scaling of disguises and you tuck a practiced protest into the twitch of the quilt, trying to draw sympathy from the hush.
Narrator: You hear the mound’s unnatural rhythm and the curled lip as evidence; the house’s small betrayals multiply against the wolf’s protestations.
huntsman: You let each small, animal motion—powder on whiskers, spectacles riding a snout—stack into a case; the specifics make the accusation heavier and the bow steadier.
Narrator: You watch the hunter reposition with a patience that counts seams as if they were clues; the clear line through patchwork becomes a line through pretense.
wolf: You feel the angle of that glance as an unraveling and you lean on invitation—closer, see for yourself—hoping proximity will blur scrutiny.
Narrator: You catch the drooping nightcap and the long brow as contradictions to the wolf’s plea; the twitching quilt reads like a repeatable motion, not ailment.
huntsman: You take the nightcap and claw marks as simple, undeniable facts; the image of a muzzle, not a face, hardens your voice into the verdict you give.
Narrator: You register the domestic details—the sewing kit, basin, towels—as a stage set too tidy for the creature beneath; your counting returns the hunter’s gaze to essentials.
wolf: You hear the hunter’s catalogue and your softening turns to a last-ditch tenderness—the child, the wakefulness you claim—to pull on whatever thread of mercy remains.
Narrator: You let the silence stretch and measure breath against breath; the hush is a place where choices are named before the blade speaks.
huntsman: You feel the weight of that silence as permission; the hunter’s low, even judgement lands as a conclusion you had already been walking toward.
