* Narrator: The bed bellows slow, the quilt mounded like a harvest sack; nightcap cocked, spectacles fogged, a powder-white muzzle just peeking.
* "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here," says huntsman, bow rising with a quiet draw.
* "Wolf?" purrs wolf, thin as old tea. "Grandmama is all aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom."
* Narrator: The clock ticks stubborn, ash slumps on the grate, and sour musk rides under flour-dust and thyme.
* "Tracks run fat and straight to this door," says huntsman. "None leaving."
* Narrator: He keeps his bow low until the shot, then brings it level; eyes sweep rafters, corners, underbed shadow.
* "Such accusations," says wolf, breath smoothing the quilt. "Would you point arrows at a frail old woman?"
* Narrator: The mound lifts and settles in a rhythm too strong for age; whiskered lips curve with a lazy satisfaction.
* "That smell is wolf, and fresh," says huntsman. "Powder wiped on whiskers. Spectacles riding a snout."
* Narrator: Two careful steps right, angling past the dresser glass; he finds a clear line through patchwork seams.
* "You mistake a grandmother’s poor nose for… brutishness," says wolf, feigning hurt. "Come nearer; you’ll see."
* Narrator: The nightcap droops, can’t hide the long brow; the quilt twitches when the bowstring whispers.
* "Old women don’t wear muzzles," says huntsman. "And they don’t leave claw marks in damp earth."
* Narrator: He notes the sewing kit tin by the bedside, basin and towels at the ready; his gaze flicks, counts, returns.
* "Cruel man," says wolf, voice sugared. "Set that thing down. You’ll wake the child."
* Narrator: A beat of silence. He measures breath to breath. The house holds its own.
* "If you were human, I couldn’t do this," says huntsman, low and even. "For beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."
