You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
A hundred yards out he heard Red's brief, strangled cry, cut then muffled by the pines. He left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He followed wide pads and claw marks pressed into the damp, pine-scented earth—wolf spoor, pads and claw marks that ran fat and straight to the sill and did not lead away.

He circled the cottage once. He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees. He paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered. Its steady tick measured a calm that was forced.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door fall without a sound. Floorboards showed no scuffle. The table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was no longer warm; a ring of cooled steam rimmed the lid. The fire had died to grey. The air inside told him things: sour fur-musk, flour dust, ash by the hearth. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed.

The bed’s quilt bulged extra-round, a mound too full for a single elder’s frame. Spectacles glinted on the bolster, powder on the pillow. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it was long-muzzled. The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age.

His eyes swept rafters, corners, the shadow under the bed. He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drove the bow up. Steady. The mound moved. The beast smelled him.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Huntsman, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
I have found you wolf, says the huntsman. Your terrible deeds end here. 
The wolf protests once that he is an old Grandma, how dare he accuse of such.  The Huntsman points out all the clues, the and to double underline it, wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman.
The huntsman declares, "If you were human, I couldn't do this, but for the beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here."

Whiskers twitching, the wolf purred, "Such accusations. Grandmother is all aches and coughs; mind your tone in a sickroom."

The bed exhaled; the patchwork hid a predator's line. The clock ticked, counting down to the draw.

The huntsman stepped closer, eyes narrowed. "Tracks run fat and straight to this door. They don't leave." He pinched the seam between thumb and forefinger; a puff of flour rose and the whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath; a sour fur-musk threaded with flour dust rose to his nostrils. "Tracks, the sour musk, spectacles perched on a snout."

The wolf's voice went honeyed. "You mistake frailty for brutality, hunter. Come closer—see how feeble she is."

The nightcap drooped; a long brow showed through the patchwork. The quilt twitched and the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Trim duplicate claims about tracks: combine "Tracks run fat and straight to this door. They don't leave." into one crisp line (e.g., "Tracks run fat and straight to this door—no leaving.").

- Tighten the huntsman’s speech to match his cadence. Shorten "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here." to something leaner but forceful (e.g., "I've found you, wolf. Your deeds end here.") or split into two clipped beats with a pause for effect.

- Tone down or rework metaphor-heavy narration that blunts immediacy: replace "The bed exhaled; the patchwork hid a predator's line" with a direct physical beat (e.g., "The patchwork shifted; something long and warm moved beneath.").

- Reduce repetition around spectacles/long snout: choose one clean reveal rather than several echoes. For example, have the spectacles slide down as the single clear reveal, then let the huntsman react to that one image.

- Make the huntsman’s evidence-listing more tactile and economical: pull the flour/whisker/flour-dust senses into a single measured observation line (e.g., "Flour on the seams, whiskers against my hand, that sour fur-musk—Grandmother's spectacles on a snout.").

- Shift some of the wolf’s lines toward his established cadence: add sibilant elongations and softer flattery. Change "Such accusations. Grandmother is all aches and coughs; mind your tone in a sickroom." to something more sly and theatrical (e.g., "Accusations? Poor Grandmother—aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom, hunter...").

- Cut or rework cliché countdown phrasing: remove "The clock ticked, counting down to the draw." Replace with a brief sensory beat that keeps tension (e.g., "The mantle clock kept its slow, indifferent tick. He stepped closer.").

- Add a small physical action to ground the huntsman before his verdict: a short beat such as "He lifted the spectacles between forefinger and thumb, held them to the light." This underscores his proof and gives space before the final line.

- Soften overt explanation about muzzles vs. human profile—show, don't tell: instead of stating "wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman," have the huntsman gesture to the long snout or say a concise, character-consistent line (e.g., "That's no elder's profile—it's a muzzle.").

- Preserve the final moral line but increase its weight with a pause or physical detail beforehand. Insert a spare stage direction (one short sentence) before "If you were human..." so the huntsman’s authority lands (e.g., "He set the spectacles down slowly. 'If you were human...'").

- Remove any moments where characters narrate their own visible actions in dialogue (e.g., avoid lines like "Come closer—see how feeble she is" that ask the reader to look; instead have the wolf invite and the narration describe the action).

- Consider one small action beat after the huntsman's final line to close the scene (a released breath, the bow drawn, or the wolf's purr tightening). Keep it minimal to preserve momentum.
