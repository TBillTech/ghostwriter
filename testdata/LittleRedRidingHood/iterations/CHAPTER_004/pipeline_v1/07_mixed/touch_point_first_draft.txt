Night breathes into the room, heavy as fate, while the quilt swells with a hidden shape; a powder-white muzzle glints from beneath the cover, and the moment thickens with the hunter's coming decision.
Huntsman, bow lifted, enunciated "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here.."
Wolf, whiskers twitching, purred "Such accusations. Grandmother is all aches and coughs; mind your tone in a sickroom.."
Night presses in as the bed exhales; the patchwork hides a predator's line, and the clock's stubborn tick counts down to the moment of the draw.
Huntsman, eyes narrowed, stated "Tracks run fat and straight to this door. None leaving.."
Bow low, the hunter studies the room, counting seams and shadows for a shift in truth; the clock on the sagging mantel ticks with stubborn patience as the line through patchwork hardens into the shape of an answer.
Wolf, hand smoothing quilt, murmured "You overstep, hunter. Grandmother is all aches and coughs; mind your tone in a sickroom.?"
Clock ticks stubbornly; ash settles, and a sour musk threads flour-dust as the room braces for the next line.
Huntsman, nostrils flared, stated "That smell is wolf, and fresh. Powder wiped on whiskers. Spectacles riding a snout.."
Two careful steps right tighten the room into a single line along the patchwork seam; the hunter's gaze crosses the shadowed edge. The house holds its breath as truth edges toward speech.
Wolf, voice honeyed, feigned "You mistake a grandmother’s poor nose for brutishness. Come nearer; you’ll see.."
Nightcap droops and the long brow shows through; the quilt twitches as truth threads its way through the patchwork.
Huntsman, jaw set, declared "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts of the forest, you are judged—by me, jury and executioner.."
Patchwork seams listen; in the hush the room waits for the word that names what the seams have already told.
Wolf, voice softened, pleaded "Cruel man. Set that thing down; you'll wake the child.."
Silence stretches, and the room holds its breath as the moment of choice nears the blade.
Huntsman, voice low, intoned "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts of the forest, you are judged—by me, jury and executioner.."
