* The latch clicks; the door settles into its frame.
* red sets the Basket of Goodies on the table.
* red hangs the Red Hood on the chair-back; the cloth catches a bit of light.
* grandma straightens the tablecloth; the creak of a floorboard answers.
* The clock counts a steady beat on the mantel.
* Bread comes out of the basket; the loaf shows a clean village cut.
* Jam is unwrapped; a spoon glints and rests in the ruby shine.
* grandma pours tea into two cups; the porcelain answers with a thin chime.
* red slices two rounds of bread; crumbs fall in a neat trail across the board.
* Jam spreads thick; the spoon leaves a glossy path and a small ridge.
* Butter softens at the knife’s touch; the edge smooths the bread’s face.
* Cups are lifted; steam curls around noses and disappears toward the rafters.
* They eat bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of their small motions.
* The latch is checked a final time; dusk leans on the window.
* The day closes over the cottage.
* The End.
