- Story so far:
Red had promised sweets and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow, while the sleek, flattering wolf slipped away along a deer-track to the cottage, reached it first, and with practiced calm swallowed Grandmother whole before setting the room into a careful masquerade; he powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, soothed the quilt and set the teapot whispering so the house would answer Red with the warmth of kin. She stepped inside to net curtains that sifted the afternoon into green pools and called softly, basket in hand, and a coaxing, grandmotherly coo—too slick, too practiced—bade her nearer; thyme and tea rose but a sour, wrong musk threaded the bed's shadow, the candle bent light into pooling dark, spectacles glinted on an oddly shaped silhouette and the nightcap drooped over a curious ear-tip. Red, humming a nursery tune, hesitated as angles read wrong and the cover shifted with a weight not belonging to age; the voice purred, urging her closer, patting the quilt in a deliberate, inviting rhythm, and when she asked the small questions—about eyes, ears, nose, nails—the answers came honeyed and false until whiskers powdered like flour in the gloom and the quilt yawned: a paw hooked the edge, spectacles fogged and were wiped with a slow, contented sigh, the basket toppled, a scream was swallowed as warm dark folded around Red, Grandmother folded within the wolf's belly, and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady, indifferent tick of the clock.

- Story relative to:
Red's point of view
I had meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise, my hood catching the light as I stepped into the cottage that seemed to lean toward me—and the room answered with a wrongness that tugged at the edges of my certainty. Sun freckled the floor; net curtains sliced the afternoon into green pools and thyme and tea rose from the kettle, but a sour musk threaded beneath those homely smells and the curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched. The voice that answered was too slick, too practiced; it cooed and patted and urged me closer until small things read wrong: a chair nudged askew as if staged, spectacles glinting on a long shadow, a nightcap pulled too low over a pricked ear-tip, powder scored the pillow like a careless hand. I set the basket down at the foot of the bed because I trusted the voice, because the coaxing sounded like Grandmother, and when I stepped forward to kiss the pillow the breath beneath it answered too deep. Each question I asked—the eyes, the ears, the nose, the nails—was met with honeyed falsehoods that flattened the room around me, and the clock stuttered one late tick as the quilt rustled wrong. Whiskers powdered the gloom, a paw hooked the cover, the patchwork yawned like a mouth, and my scream was swallowed as warm dark folded over me and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady tick remaining.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patient craft kept me light on the shingles and warm in the thyme; I slipped in before her, checked the latch, let the house breathe out mint and ash and the teapot hiss to keep up appearances, and set the stage with little disarrangements—a chair nudged, the nightcap tugged low, spectacles tilted, powder scored the pillow—so everything would look like age and forgetting. When Red stepped across the threshold, hood bright against the dim, I pooled my voice into a kinder thing and let it purr through the room, coaxing her to set the basket by the bed and come closer. Sun freckled the floor, the curtain hem moved though the window was latched, a sour musk threaded beneath the thyme to distract her, and I answered every soft question with a sweeter lie until muscles gathered under the quilt. I timed the stutter of the clock and the teapot’s chatter, watched her fingers tighten on the napkin, felt the basket tilt as her heel skidded—then the patchwork opened. Whiskers powdered the gloom, I wiped the spectacles with a slow contented sigh, hooked the cover with a paw, and the bed swallowed them both; I smoothed my sleeve, the candle thinned to a bead, and the cottage resumed its ordinary pose with a new warmth at the hip and the steady tick marking my patient satisfaction.

Forest Path's point of view
I kept the pale dust and sunbeams for her small feet and felt the wolf uncoil through my thyme long before either of them reached the cottage; I watched him time his knock to the tilt of the light and saw the house lean in as Red hummed her way along, hood bright, basket creaking like a promise. Sun freckled the floor when she nudged the door and called, and I took in the little betrayals inside—the curtained green pools, the kettle’s steam, the chair nudged as if left in a hurry, the candle bending light into dark pools—signs the wolf had been working his stagecraft. The voice that came back was slick and coaxing, and I felt the room hold its breath when Red stepped closer, fingers tightening at the napkin, the basket set at the bed's foot. The clock stuttered, the teapot chattered, the quilt rustled with breaths too long for age; whiskers powdered the gloom, spectacles fogged and were wiped, a paw hooked the edge, and the patchwork yawned. I kept the thin bar of light where her footsteps had passed as the bed closed over a new fullness, the cottage smoothed, and the mantle's tick resumed, carrying the echo of her vanished song along my lane.

- Actors: Red, Grandmother, Huntsman
- Foreshadowing: 
- Prior paragraph (if any): Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—you'll track the forest into my rug. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm and curtsied. "Please take a bit of bread for your road." She looked at him with hopeful eyes.

"Keep the basket. You need it," the huntsman said, and he nodded once.

"No need. I'll take care of the beast." He inclines his head, shoulders the bow, moves to the door.

"Latch the door at dusk," he added as he stepped toward the path. "The woods will be quieter for now, but mind the night." He checked the way with a quick look.

"You're a comfort to us, truly," Grandmother murmured, smiling. She breathed out, steadier now.

The room settled; the clock counted a quieter pace as the wolf was carried away. Warmth pooled by the stove as if the house remembered how to be itself.

"Take care of one another." The huntsman tipped his cap and stepped back onto the path.

=== RESPONSE ===
The latch clicks and the door settles into its frame behind me. I step inside and hang my Red Hood over the chair-back; the cloth catches a bit of the late light and throws a warm splash across the back of the chair. I set the Basket of Goodies on the table and watch Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as if the house is settling around us. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

I lift the lid of the basket and take out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. I slice two rounds, crumbs falling in a neat trail across the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam; the spoon glints and rests in the ruby shine, and the jam spreads thick, leaving a glossy path and a small ridge. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. We lift the cups and steam curls around our noses, drifting up toward the rafters. We eat bread and jam, the table taking the gentle thrum of our small motions. Before the light goes, I check the latch one last time, remembering the Huntsman's caution, and dusk leans on the window until the day closes over the cottage. The End.
