The latch clicks and the door settles into its frame behind me. I step inside and hang my Red Hood over the chair-back; the cloth catches a bit of the late light and throws a warm splash across the back of the chair. I set the Basket of Goodies on the table and watch Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as if the house is settling around us. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

I lift the lid of the basket and take out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. I slice two rounds, crumbs falling in a neat trail across the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam; the spoon glints and rests in the ruby shine, and the jam spreads thick, leaving a glossy path and a small ridge. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. We lift the cups and steam curls around our noses, drifting up toward the rafters. We eat bread and jam, the table taking the gentle thrum of our small motions. Before the light goes, I check the latch one last time, remembering the Huntsman's caution, and dusk leans on the window until the day closes over the cottage. The End.
