I step inside and hang my red hood over the chair-back; the hood catches the late light and warms the chair. I set the basket of goodies on the table and watch Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as the house settles around us. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

"I brought bread and jam, Grandmother," I say, clutching the basket and curtsying.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answers, smiling.

I lift the lid of the basket and take out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. I slice two rounds, crumbs falling in a neat trail across the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam; the spoon glints and rests in the ruby shine, and the jam spreads thick and glossy. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. Grandmother and I lift the cups and steam curls around our noses, drifting up toward the rafters. Grandmother and I eat bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of our small motions. Before the light goes, I check the latch one last time; I remember the Huntsman's warning: "Latch the door at dusk." Dusk leans on the window until the day closes over the cottage.

"Stay a while, dear," Grandmother says.

Grandmother and I have tea, bread, and jam.
