A hundred yards out, hearing Red's brief, strangled cry cut and then muffled by the pines, the huntsman left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He followed wide pads and claw marks pressed into the damp, pine-scented earth—Wolf Tracks that ran fat and straight to the sill and did not lead away. The huntsman circled the cottage once, counting the clock’s stubborn ticks and the slow settling of roof under the trees, then paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered, its steady tick measuring a calm that felt contrived.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door fall without a sound. Floorboards showed no scuffle; the table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was warm no longer, beads of cooled steam pearling the lid. Hearthstones were stacked clean; the fire had died to grey and silence. The air inside carried a sour fur-musk braided under flour dust and the ash that belonged by the hearth. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed. The bed’s quilt bulged extra-round, a mound too full for a single elder’s frame. Spectacles glinted on the bolster and powder flecked the pillow like sifted flour. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it ran long in the muzzle. The mound lifted and settled in a slow rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing the huntsman expected from age. His eyes swept rafters, corners, and the shadow under the bed. He eased a boot onto a plank that did not creak, set his range, nocked an arrow, and raised his bow smooth and steady—then, in the hush between one tick and the next, Wolf noticed that the huntsman had come.
