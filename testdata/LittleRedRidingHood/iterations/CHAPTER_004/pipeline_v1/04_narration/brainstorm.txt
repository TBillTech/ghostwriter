* A hundred yards outside the cottage a lone huntsman hears Red's scream, and approaches.
* The huntsman circles the cottage once, counting ticks and roof-settling under the pines.
* Wolf Tracks run fat and straight to the sill and do not lead away.
* The door stands ajar; the huntsman tests the edge with two fingers and keeps his bow low.
* He listens at the jamb; only the Clock answers with its steady tick.
* The air inside carries fur-musk under flour dust and old ash.
* The huntsman slips over the threshold and lets the door rest without a sound.
* Floorboards show no scuffle; the Table sits neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed.
* The Teapot is warm no longer; beads of cooled steam pearl its lid.
* Hearthstones are stacked clean; the fire is down to grey and silence.
* Net curtains hang still; dust motes churn only where lamplight pools by the bed.
* The bed’s quilt is extra-round, a mound too full for a single elder’s frame.
* The mound lifts and settles in a slow rhythm that does not match age’s frail breath.
* Spectacles glint on the bolster; powder flecks the pillow like sifted flour.
* A nightcap is tugged low; the outline beneath it runs long in the muzzle.
* The huntsman’s eyes sweep rafters, corners, and the under-bed shadow.
* He eases a foot to the plank that does not creak and sets his range.
* He nocks an arrow; bow comes up smooth; suddenly, Wolf notices the huntsman is there.
