A hundred yards out he heard Red's brief, strangled cry, cut then muffled by the pines. He left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He followed wide pads and claw marks pressed into the damp, pine-scented earth—wolf spoor, pads and claw marks that ran fat and straight to the sill and did not lead away.

He circled the cottage once. He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees. He paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered. Its steady tick measured a calm that was forced.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door fall without a sound. Floorboards showed no scuffle. The table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was no longer warm; a ring of cooled steam rimmed the lid. The fire had died to grey. The air inside told him things: sour fur-musk, flour dust, ash by the hearth. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed.

The bed’s quilt bulged extra-round, a mound too full for a single elder’s frame. Spectacles glinted on the bolster, powder on the pillow. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it was long-muzzled. The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age.

His eyes swept rafters, corners, the shadow under the bed. He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drove the bow up. Steady. The mound moved. The beast smelled him.
