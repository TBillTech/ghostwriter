=== SYSTEM ===
You will order and refine brainstormed bullet points for coherent flow.

=== USER ===
You are a director examining the output of a creative brainstorming session, also working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is simply to order the bullets in the most logial sequence possible. You are not allowed to take bullets away.
You are however, allowed to add new intermediate bullets to help the sequence make more sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised sweets and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow, while the sleek, flattering wolf slipped away along a deer-track to the cottage, reached it first, and with practiced calm swallowed Grandmother whole before setting the room into a careful masquerade; he powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, soothed the quilt and set the teapot whispering so the house would answer Red with the warmth of kin. She stepped inside to net curtains that sifted the afternoon into green pools and called softly, basket in hand, and a coaxing, grandmotherly coo—too slick, too practiced—bade her nearer; thyme and tea rose but a sour, wrong musk threaded the bed's shadow, the candle bent light into pooling dark, spectacles glinted on an oddly shaped silhouette and the nightcap drooped over a curious ear-tip. Red, humming a nursery tune, hesitated as angles read wrong and the cover shifted with a weight not belonging to age; the voice purred, urging her closer, patting the quilt in a deliberate, inviting rhythm, and when she asked the small questions—about eyes, ears, nose, nails—the answers came honeyed and false until whiskers powdered like flour in the gloom and the quilt yawned: a paw hooked the edge, spectacles fogged and were wiped with a slow, contented sigh, the basket toppled, a scream was swallowed as warm dark folded around Red, Grandmother folded within the wolf's belly, and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady, indifferent tick of the clock.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I had meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise, my hood catching the light as I stepped into the cottage that seemed to lean toward me—and the room answered with a wrongness that tugged at the edges of my certainty. Sun freckled the floor; net curtains sliced the afternoon into green pools and thyme and tea rose from the kettle, but a sour musk threaded beneath those homely smells and the curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched. The voice that answered was too slick, too practiced; it cooed and patted and urged me closer until small things read wrong: a chair nudged askew as if staged, spectacles glinting on a long shadow, a nightcap pulled too low over a pricked ear-tip, powder scored the pillow like a careless hand. I set the basket down at the foot of the bed because I trusted the voice, because the coaxing sounded like Grandmother, and when I stepped forward to kiss the pillow the breath beneath it answered too deep. Each question I asked—the eyes, the ears, the nose, the nails—was met with honeyed falsehoods that flattened the room around me, and the clock stuttered one late tick as the quilt rustled wrong. Whiskers powdered the gloom, a paw hooked the cover, the patchwork yawned like a mouth, and my scream was swallowed as warm dark folded over me and the cottage smoothed back into its domestic hush with only the steady tick remaining.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patient craft kept me light on the shingles and warm in the thyme; I slipped in before her, checked the latch, let the house breathe out mint and ash and the teapot hiss to keep up appearances, and set the stage with little disarrangements—a chair nudged, the nightcap tugged low, spectacles tilted, powder scored the pillow—so everything would look like age and forgetting. When Red stepped across the threshold, hood bright against the dim, I pooled my voice into a kinder thing and let it purr through the room, coaxing her to set the basket by the bed and come closer. Sun freckled the floor, the curtain hem moved though the window was latched, a sour musk threaded beneath the thyme to distract her, and I answered every soft question with a sweeter lie until muscles gathered under the quilt. I timed the stutter of the clock and the teapot’s chatter, watched her fingers tighten on the napkin, felt the basket tilt as her heel skidded—then the patchwork opened. Whiskers powdered the gloom, I wiped the spectacles with a slow contented sigh, hooked the cover with a paw, and the bed swallowed them both; I smoothed my sleeve, the candle thinned to a bead, and the cottage resumed its ordinary pose with a new warmth at the hip and the steady tick marking my patient satisfaction.

Forest Path's point of view
I kept the pale dust and sunbeams for her small feet and felt the wolf uncoil through my thyme long before either of them reached the cottage; I watched him time his knock to the tilt of the light and saw the house lean in as Red hummed her way along, hood bright, basket creaking like a promise. Sun freckled the floor when she nudged the door and called, and I took in the little betrayals inside—the curtained green pools, the kettle’s steam, the chair nudged as if left in a hurry, the candle bending light into dark pools—signs the wolf had been working his stagecraft. The voice that came back was slick and coaxing, and I felt the room hold its breath when Red stepped closer, fingers tightening at the napkin, the basket set at the bed's foot. The clock stuttered, the teapot chattered, the quilt rustled with breaths too long for age; whiskers powdered the gloom, spectacles fogged and were wiped, a paw hooked the edge, and the patchwork yawned. I kept the thin bar of light where her footsteps had passed as the bed closed over a new fullness, the cottage smoothed, and the mantle's tick resumed, carrying the echo of her vanished song along my lane.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Approach to the Silent Cottage', 'description': "Evening lays a green hush over the pines as a huntsman follows a ribbon of prints that lope from streambank to door. A child's cry—brief, strangled, then swallowed by the trees—has already sent him off the trail and toward the cottage with his Bow low and his breath held.\nThe door stands ajar. Inside, no chatter of kettle, no clatter of cups—only the measured ticking of a clock and a smell that is not illness, not age, but wild.\n", 'props': [{'name': "Huntsman's Skinning Knife", 'significance': 'Separating tissues from bone', 'description': 'A well-kept skinning knife suitable for gutting and releasing victims from the belly of Wolf'}, {'name': "Huntsman's Bow", 'significance': 'Instrument of Sudden and Unexpected Punishment from Afar', 'description': 'A well-kept huntsman’s Compound Bow, used for hunting beasts.'}, {'name': 'Wolf Tracks', 'significance': 'Trail of intrusion', 'description': 'Wide pads and claw marks pressed into damp earth, leading straight to the cottage threshold.'}, {'name': 'Teapot', 'significance': 'Interrupted domesticity', 'description': 'A squat iron pot, warm no longer, its lid beaded with cooled steam.'}, {'name': 'Clock', 'significance': 'Tension and timing', 'description': 'A mantle clock that ticks with stubborn steadiness, marking a calm that feels wrong.'}, {'name': 'Hearthstones', 'significance': 'Future means to end the threat', 'description': 'Smooth river stones stacked by the hearth, heavy and clean with ash-dust.'}]}

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide your results as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character.
2. **Clean Lines**: If there are intent words at the beginning of the given bullets, for example "Clarity - ", or "Flavor: " leave those out and just recover the point without a title.
3. **Just Bullets Output**: Strip off, ignore, and do not output any markdown or other formatting, other than just only '*' character at line start.

Now, Here are the Bullets to be ordered in as logical a way as possible:
* A hundred yards outside the cottage a lone huntsman hears Red's scream, and approaches.
* The huntsman circles the cottage once, counting ticks and roof-settling under the pines.
* Wolf Tracks run fat and straight to the sill and do not lead away.
* The door stands ajar; the huntsman tests the edge with two fingers and keeps his bow low.
* He listens at the jamb; only the Clock answers with its steady tick.
* The air inside carries fur-musk under flour dust and old ash.
* The huntsman slips over the threshold and lets the door rest without a sound.
* Floorboards show no scuffle; the Table sits neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed.
* The Teapot is warm no longer; beads of cooled steam pearl its lid.
* Hearthstones are stacked clean; the fire is down to grey and silence.
* Net curtains hang still; dust motes churn only where lamplight pools by the bed.
* The bed’s quilt is extra-round, a mound too full for a single elder’s frame.
* The mound lifts and settles in a slow rhythm that does not match age’s frail breath.
* Spectacles glint on the bolster; powder flecks the pillow like sifted flour.
* A nightcap is tugged low; the outline beneath it runs long in the muzzle.
* The huntsman’s eyes sweep rafters, corners, and the under-bed shadow.
* He eases a foot to the plank that does not creak and sets his range.
* He nocks an arrow; bow comes up smooth; suddenly, Wolf notices the huntsman is there.
