- Make the huntsman’s actions crisper and more deliberate to match his cadence: break long sentences into shorter beats (e.g., split the opening sentence; use tactile verbs like “picked up,” “checked,” “set”).
- Add an explicit second listening-beat after he circles the cottage (“he listens again”) before slipping inside so the touch-point is clearly present.
- When describing the quiet as manufactured, use plainer diction that feels observant not poetic (replace “felt contrived” with something like “made” or “forced” quiet).
- Replace the capitalized “Wolf Tracks” with lower-case “wolf tracks” and use concrete hunting language (e.g., “wolf spoor,” “pads and claw marks”) to fit the Huntsman lexicon.
- Clarify the ambiguous pronoun: change “the outline beneath it ran long in the muzzle” to an unambiguous phrase (suggestion: “the outline beneath it was long-muzzled” or “the face beneath it ran long and muzzled”).
- Trim or simplify florid images that clash with the Huntsman’s plain voice (e.g., “beads of cooled steam pearling the lid” → “a ring of cooled steam on the lid”; “powder flecked the pillow like sifted flour” → “powder on the pillow”).
- Preserve important sensory details (fur-musk, flour dust, undisturbed table, extra-round quilt) but make their sequence more forensic—have the Huntsman note them as signs: short clauses separated by commas or bullets in the sentence.
- When he prepares his shot, use hunting-specific phrasing and short commands: “He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drove the bow up. Steady.” Replace the long clause “raised his bow smooth and steady” with this rhythm.
- Reconsider “then, in the hush between one tick and the next, Wolf noticed that the huntsman had come.” Either shift to passive tense to keep the focus on the Huntsman (“…then, in the hush, the shape beneath the quilt moved”) or rephrase so the observation stays in the huntsman’s register (e.g., “The mound moved. A beast smelled him.”).
- Remove any extra adjectives that soften threat/clarity (e.g., “slow settling of roof under the trees” → “the roof settling slow”) to keep prose taut and watchful.
