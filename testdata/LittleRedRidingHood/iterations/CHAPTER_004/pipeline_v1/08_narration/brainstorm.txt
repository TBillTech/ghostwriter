* The room holds its breath as huntsman draws, counts, and looses.
* The arrow hums through candle air and bedsheets and strikes wolf clean in the eye.
* Spectacles leap; the nightcap flips; powder lifts like ash and settles on the quilt.
* The bed heaves once; wolf shudders and sinks, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, arrow lifting to the ceiling.
* The belly still moves beneath the quilt, round and slow, as if something trapped remembers air.
* Huntsman lowers the bow, sets it by the hearthstones, and lays a steady palm on the mound to feel life within.
* He turns back the quilt to the chin of wolf and the ruin of the eye, confirming the kill.
* He rolls the body a hand’s width to free space on the mattress and reaches for his skinning knife.
* The porcelain basin is drawn near; clean towels are unrolled across the bedside stool.
* With blade point he finds the soft seam of belly and draws a measured line, careful and sure.
* Warm breath and herb-sour steam rise; the quilt drinks the damp and the candle gutters once.
* Grandmother spills first, pale and blinking, coughing tea air and powder, alive.
* Huntsman guides her to the chair, wraps a towel around her shoulders, and steadies her feet.
* The mound slackens and shifts; a small form works forward through the rent.
* Red slides free, slick with wolf’s remains and flour dust; a towel is set over her hair and face.
* The belly sags flat; the quilt puddles around the ribs; the room’s shapes right themselves.
* The arrow’s feathering trembles in the ruined eye; disguise garments lie askew on the pillow.
* Huntsman wipes the knife on a clean cloth, checks breath and pulse of the rescued.
