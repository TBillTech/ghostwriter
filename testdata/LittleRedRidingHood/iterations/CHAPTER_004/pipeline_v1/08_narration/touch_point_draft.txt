The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf, burying itself in the wolf's eye. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; powder rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; the borrowed garments lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin and the ruin of the eye, confirming the kill, then lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones. He laid a steady palm on the mound to feel life within. He froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand’s width to free the mattress and drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman set the skinning knife's edge at the soft seam, then cut with the steady, practiced hand of a hunter.

The mound slackened and shifted; something small worked forward through the rent. Grandmother spilled out first—pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and powder, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid free next, slick with the wolf’s blood and flour dust; the Huntsman set a towel over her hair and face, guided her to the chair, wrapped another towel about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. The Huntsman wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother’s breath and pulse, checked Red’s, and the cottage began, very slowly, to remember how to be a house again.
