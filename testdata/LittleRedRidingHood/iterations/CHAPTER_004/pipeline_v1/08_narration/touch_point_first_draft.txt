The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf clean in the eye. Spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; powder rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow tilting up toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; the borrowed garments lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Warm breath and herb-sour steam pushed through the cloth; the quilt drank the damp and the candle guttered once. Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin of the wolf and the ruin of the eye, confirming the kill, then lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones. He laid a steady palm on the mound to feel life within, rolled the body a hand’s width to free the mattress, and reached for his skinning knife.

He drew the porcelain basin near and unrolled clean towels across the bedside stool. With the blade point he found the soft seam of belly and drew a measured line, careful and sure. The mound slackened and shifted; something small worked forward through the rent. Grandmother spilled out first—pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and powder, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. I slid free next, slick with the wolf’s remains and flour dust; Huntsman set a towel over my hair and face, guided me to the chair, wrapped another towel about my shoulders, and steadied my feet. Huntsman wiped the knife on a clean cloth, checked Grandmother’s breath and pulse, checked mine, and the cottage began, very slowly, to remember how to be a house again.
