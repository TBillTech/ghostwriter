- Replace vague nouns with names to remove ambiguity: e.g., change "He laid a steady palm on the mound" → "The Huntsman laid a steady palm on the wolf's belly" (or "on the quilted mound covering the wolf's belly") so it's clear whose body/mound is meant.

- Make the arrow-in-eye impact explicit and final: emphasize death in same sentence as the shot (e.g., "the arrow struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead") so the kill reads unequivocally and matches the touch-point.

- Clarify which garments belong to whom: replace "the borrowed garments lay askew" with "Grandmother's nightcap and spectacles lay askew" (or "the wolf's borrowed nightgown lay askew") to avoid reader confusion about who wore what.

- Fix mixed imagery of "powder" vs "flour": pick one term and use it consistently (the prior touch-points use "flour"; prefer "flour dust" here). Change all instances of "powder" to "flour" if that is the intended detail.

- Remove passive/indirect phrasing where it blunts the sequence: change "The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin and the ruin of the eye" → "The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin, exposing the ruined eye" for tighter clarity.

- Reorder minor actions for logical flow: draw the basin and lay towels before rolling the body (or state clearly why he rolls first). For example: "He set the bow against the hearthstones, drew a basin and laid towels on the stool, then rolled the body a hand's width to free the mattress."

- Make the Huntsman's procedure language match his character (spare, technical): replace "set the skinning knife's edge at the soft seam, then cut with the steady, practiced hand of a hunter" → "He set the skinning knife to the seam and cut, steady and economical." (Keeps hunter cadence, removes florid phrasing.)

- Replace "something small worked forward through the rent" with a clearer but still slightly strange image: "A thin arm slipped through the rent—then Grandmother tumbled out" (this preserves surprise but names first emergent actor to reduce ambiguity).

- State discovery sequence explicitly and starkly: ensure sentence order reads: arrow hits → wolf slumps dead → Huntsman notices moving belly → Huntsman cuts belly → Grandmother emerges → Red emerges. Consider condensing into a tightened paragraph so the reader cannot mis-order events.

- Clarify Red's condition and handling more concretely: change "Red, slick with the wolf’s blood and flour dust; the Huntsman set a towel over her hair and face..." → "Red slid out next, slick with wolf's blood and flour dust. The Huntsman covered her hair with a towel, guided her to a chair, wrapped another about her shoulders, and steadied her feet." (Make actions discrete and subject clear.)

- Make medical checks explicit: replace "checked Grandmother’s breath and pulse, checked Red’s" → "checked Grandmother's breath and pulse, then checked Red's pulse and breathing" to remove trailing ambiguity.

- Tighten or remove mild repetition: consider cutting "the cottage began, very slowly, to remember how to be a house again" or make it more concise to preserve the eerie tone without diluting the surgical moment (e.g., "the cottage slowly remembered itself").
