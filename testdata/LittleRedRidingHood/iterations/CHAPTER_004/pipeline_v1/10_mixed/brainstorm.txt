* Flavor: grandma croaks out, “Thank you, sir. I’m sorry for the mess,” clutching the towel like a cloak.
* Flavor: huntsman, soft and low: “I’m glad I could be of service, ma’am.”
* Flavor: red offers the Basket of Goodies with both hands. “Please—take bread for your road.”
* Flavor: huntsman takes only a heel. “Thank you kindly, but I'll leave the rest for you poor souls.”
* Flavor: grandma fusses tiredly. “Mind your boots; you’ll track the forest into my rug,” then laughs at herself and pats his sleeve.
* Flavor: huntsman drapes a sheet over the wolf, wraps it tight, and lifts it onto his shoulder. “No cause to look on it again.”
* Flavor: the clock resumes its steady tick; the kettle sighs; flour-dust drifts like quiet snow in the sun-slice.
* Flavor: at the door, huntsman pauses. “Latch at dusk. But these woods should be safer for a while.” He taps the wood once, a promise kept.
* Flavor: red calls after him, “Thank you,” with a little curtsey that wobbles.
* Flavor: grandma adds, softer, “You’re a comfort to us, truly,” and the huntsman tips two fingers to his cap instead of a bow.
* Flavor: outside, his boots fade on the Forest Path; inside, cups chink, and the house remembers its old warmth.
* Clarity: huntsman will take the carcass away for bounty and to spare them the mess.
