You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I have found you, wolf. Your terrible deeds end here."

Whiskers twitching, the wolf purred, "Such accusations. Grandmother is all aches and coughs; mind your tone in a sickroom."

The bed exhaled; the patchwork hid a predator's line. The clock ticked, counting down to the draw.

The huntsman stepped closer, eyes narrowed. "Tracks run fat and straight to this door. They don't leave." He pinched the seam between thumb and forefinger; a puff of flour rose and the whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath; a sour fur-musk threaded with flour dust rose to his nostrils. "Tracks, the sour musk, spectacles perched on a snout."

The wolf's voice went honeyed. "You mistake frailty for brutality, hunter. Come closer—see how feeble she is."

The nightcap drooped; a long brow showed through the patchwork. The quilt twitched and the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

---

The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf, burying itself in the wolf's eye. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; powder rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; the borrowed garments lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin and the ruin of the eye, confirming the kill, then lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones. He laid a steady palm on the mound to feel life within. He froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand’s width to free the mattress and drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman set the skinning knife's edge at the soft seam, then cut with the steady, practiced hand of a hunter.

The mound slackened and shifted; something small worked forward through the rent. Grandmother spilled out first—pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and powder, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid free next, slick with the wolf’s blood and flour dust; the Huntsman set a towel over her hair and face, guided her to the chair, wrapped another towel about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. The Huntsman wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother’s breath and pulse, checked Red’s, and the cottage began, very slowly, to remember how to be a house again.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Red, Grandmother, Huntsman

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
With the wolf dead, Grandmother and Red thank the huntsman. The huntsman says farewell.


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—you'll track the forest into my rug. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm and curtsied. "Please take a bit of bread for your road." She looked at him with hopeful eyes.

"Keep the basket. You need it," the huntsman said, and he nodded once.

"No need. I'll take care of the beast." He inclines his head, shoulders the bow, moves to the door.

"Latch the door at dusk," he added as he stepped toward the path. "The woods will be quieter for now, but mind the night." He checked the way with a quick look.

"You're a comfort to us, truly," Grandmother murmured, smiling. She breathed out, steadier now.

The room settled; the clock counted a quieter pace as the wolf was carried away. Warmth pooled by the stove as if the house remembered how to be itself.

"Take care of one another." The huntsman tipped his cap and stepped back onto the path.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove or trim "Mind your boots—you'll track the forest into my rug." It reads modern and clunky; replace with a shorter, homier line (e.g., "Mind your boots, dear—there's enough forest in my rug already.") or simply "Mind your boots."

- Change "I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am," to Huntsman-speech: make it shorter and more economical. Example: "Glad to help, ma'am." (Drop "I could be of service, ma'am"—too formal/long for him.)

- Combine Red's two sentences into one crisp beat to avoid small redundancy: replace
  "Red tucked the basket under her arm and curtsied. 'Please take a bit of bread for your road.' She looked at him with hopeful eyes."
  with
  "Red tucked the basket under her arm, curtsied and offered, 'Please—take a bit of bread for the road,' her eyes hopeful."
  (Keeps her cadence and saves space.)

- The huntsman's reply "Keep the basket. You need it," then the next two lines ("No need. I'll take care of the beast." "He inclines his head...") feel disjointed and ambiguous about speaker. Make speakers explicit and trim stilted phrasing:
  - Have Huntsman say one concise refusal: "No—keep it. You'll need it." 
  - Then compress action to a single tight beat: "He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and moved for the door."

- Remove/merge "He inclines his head, shoulders the bow, moves to the door." with following similar beats; choose one clear tense and stick to it (past tense throughout). Example: "He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and stepped toward the door."

- Rework the advisory line "Latch the door at dusk... mind the night." to sound like the Huntsman and less like exposition. Shorten to: "Latch your door at dusk. The woods are quiet for now, but not forever." Or, even briefer: "Latch the door at dusk. The night keeps its own counsel."

- Cut "He checked the way with a quick look." (redundant with stepping toward the path). If you want a beat, replace with "He checked the path once more."

- Remove the passive, slightly awkward sentence "The room settled; the clock counted a quieter pace as the wolf was carried away." Replace with a single sensory image: "The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold." (This keeps mood without abstract phrasing.)

- Replace "Warmth pooled by the stove as if the house remembered how to be itself." with a more domestic image in Grandmother's voice: e.g., "Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again." (Keeps lyricism but tighter.)

- Change the Huntsman's parting "Take care of one another." and tipping cap to a slightly more huntsman-like sendoff. Make it brief and deliberate: either leave as "Take care of one another," or compress: "Take care." Then give one small physical beat: "He tipped his cap and stepped onto the path."

- Add one brief action beat after the Huntsman leaves to ground Red and Grandmother's thanks without overwriting: for example, insert Grandmother's quiet "Bless you" or Red's murmured "Thank you, truly," followed by a small domestic gesture (Grandmother smoothing Red's hood or offering her a biscuit). Keep these to one short sentence to avoid slowing momentum.

- Check tense consistency: some lines use present ("He inclines") while most are past. Make all narration past tense.

- Trim redundancy in gratitude: there are three explicit thank-yous (Grandmother's opening thanks, "You're a comfort..." and later "thank you" implied). Reduce to two: Grandmother's initial thanks and a final, quiet "Thank you" from Red or Grandmother after Huntsman departs to close the scene.

- Maintain character voice constraints:
  - Ensure Grandmother's lines remain cozy and homey (use "dear," "bless you").
  - Keep Huntsman's lines short, plain, and pragmatic.
  - Keep Red's lines earnest, simple, and polite.

- Final pass: run for 1–2 tight sensory beats (a smell of warmed tea, the click of the latch, a towel on Red's shoulders) and remove any extra adjectives that don't advance mood or action.
