=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
With the wolf dead, Grandmother and Red thank the huntsman. The huntsman says farewell.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
grandma: You croak, "Thank you, sir. I'm sorry for the mess," clutching the towel like a cloak.

huntsman: You say, softly and low, "I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am."

red: You hold the Basket of Goodies out with both hands and say, "Please—take bread for your road."

huntsman: You take only a heel and reply, "Thank you kindly, but I'll leave the rest for you poor souls."

grandma: You fuss tiredly, "Mind your boots; you'll track the forest into my rug," then laugh at yourself and pat his sleeve.

huntsman: You drape a sheet over the wolf, wrap it tight, lift it onto your shoulder, and tell them, "No cause to look on it again."

Narrator: You notice the clock resume its steady tick; the kettle sighs; flour-dust drifts like quiet snow in the sun-slice.

huntsman: You pause at the door and say, "Latch at dusk. But these woods should be safer for a while," then tap the wood once, a promise kept.

red: You call after him, "Thank you," and give a little curtsey that wobbles.

grandma: You add, softer, "You're a comfort to us, truly," and watch as the huntsman tips two fingers to his cap instead of a bow.

Narrator: You hear his boots fade down the Forest Path; inside, cups chink, and the house remembers its old warmth.

huntsman: You tell them plainly you will take the carcass away for the bounty and to spare them the mess.

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* You feel obliged to give; the offering is both promise kept and comfort given.
* You care because the gesture reassures you and the recipient; your action mends worry into purpose.
* You want the other to accept the bread so the duty is fulfilled and your journey feels right.
* You also want reassurance that danger has passed and that your presence matters.
* You hide a small fear of leaving the cottage vulnerable; by giving you assuage that fear.
* Current mood: earnest, slightly unsteady with relief, polite and eager to be helpful.

grandma:
* You speak from gratitude mixed with residual alarm; words are a balm and an apology.
* You care because hospitality and order restore your sense of safety and dignity.
* You want to acknowledge aid and to lighten any burden on your guests by being modest.
* You want to keep the mood gentle and avoid alarming others with lingering worry.
* You hide a fragile pride: you dislike appearing helpless even as you depend on help.
* Current mood: warm and faintly chastened, grateful, clinging to composure through tiredness.

huntsman:
* You state service as fact and close the matter; duty completed, responsibility transferred.
* You care because finishing the task honors your skill and keeps the community safer.
* You want to be thanked but not feted; you seek practical closure and distance.
* You want the carcass removed and the household spared the mess; you accept small tokens but refuse excess.
* You hide a professional coolness that masks fatigue and a wish to be unremarked upon.
* Current mood: composed, economical, quietly satisfied with a touch of solemn reserve.
