Grandmother croaked, "Thank you, dear, for your help; mind your boots, you’ll track the forest into my rug; I’ll see to the stove and rest a moment.,"
Huntsman murmured, "I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am.."
Red offered, "Please take bread for your road.."
Huntsman accepted, "Thank you kindly, but I'll leave the rest for you poor souls.."
Grandmother fussed, "Mind your boots; you'll track the forest into my rug, dear, and I am grateful for your help.,"
Huntsman wrapped, "No cause to look on it again.."
The room settles into a softer rhythm as the wolf is carried away and the cottage breathes a gentler warmth, the clock counting a quieter pace.
Huntsman warned, "Latch at dusk; these woods should be safer for a while.,"
Red curtsied, "Thank you, sir; I offer a wobbly curtsey.,"
Grandmother murmured, "You're a comfort to us, truly; the huntsman tips his cap in quiet thanks.,"
The cottage breathes a soft hush as evening settles, and warmth lingers where fear once pressed.
Huntsman announced, "I'll take the carcass away for the bounty and to spare you the mess.."
