Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your bootsâ€”you'll track the forest into my rug. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"I'm glad I could be of service, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm and curtsied. "Please take a bit of bread for your road." She looked at him with hopeful eyes.

"Keep the basket. You need it," the huntsman said, and he nodded once.

"No need. I'll take care of the beast." He inclines his head, shoulders the bow, moves to the door.

"Latch the door at dusk," he added as he stepped toward the path. "The woods will be quieter for now, but mind the night." He checked the way with a quick look.

"You're a comfort to us, truly," Grandmother murmured, smiling. She breathed out, steadier now.

The room settled; the clock counted a quieter pace as the wolf was carried away. Warmth pooled by the stove as if the house remembered how to be itself.

"Take care of one another." The huntsman tipped his cap and stepped back onto the path.
