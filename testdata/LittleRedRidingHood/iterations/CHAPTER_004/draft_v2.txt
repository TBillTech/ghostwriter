He circles once, listens again, and slips inside. The quiet feels manufactured, the air thick with fur-musk and flour dust. His eye takes in the neat room, the undisturbed table, the bed with its extra-round quilt. He readies his bow, alerted to the strangeness.

END_TOUCHPOINT
BEGIN_RESULT
A hundred yards out the huntsman heard Red's brief, strangled cry, cut then muffled by the pines. He left the ribbon of the trail and came down toward the cottage with his bow low. He tracked fat wolf pads and claw marks straight to the sill; they did not lead away.

The huntsman circled the cottage once. He listened again. He counted the clock’s stubborn ticks and the roof settling slow under the trees. He paused where the door stood ajar and tested the edge with two careful fingers. He kept his bow low and listened at the jamb; only the mantle clock answered. Its steady tick measured a calm that was forced.

The huntsman slipped over the threshold and let the door close soundlessly. Floorboards showed no scuffle. The table sat neat, cups aligned, crumbs undisturbed. The teapot was cold; a ring of condensed steam rimmed the lid. The fire had died to grey. The air told him—fur-musk, flour dust, hearth ash. Net curtains hung still; dust motes turned only where lamplight pooled by the bed.

Grandmother's quilt bulged—an extra-round mound, too full for an old woman's frame. Grandmother's spectacles glinted on the bolster; powder dented the pillow. A nightcap drooped low; the outline beneath it was long-muzzled. The mound lifted and settled in a rhythm that did not match the feeble breathing he expected from age.

His eyes swept rafters, corners, the shadow under the bed. He eased his boot. Set his range. Nocked. Drew. Breathe. Count. The mound moved. The scent changed—close, warm, animal. He readied his bow, alerted to the strangeness.

I have found you wolf, says the huntsman. Your terrible deeds end here. 
The wolf protests once that he is an old Grandma, how dare he accuse of such.  The Huntsman points out all the clues, the and to double underline it, wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman.
The huntsman declares, "If you were human, I couldn't do this, but for the beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

Night pooled in the corner; the quilt swelled with something alive. A white muzzle glinted from beneath the cover.

The huntsman lowered the bow an inch. "I've found you, wolf. Your deeds end here."

Whiskers twitched. The wolf purred, "Accusations? Poor Grandmother—aches and coughs. Mind your tone in a sickroom, hunter..."

The patchwork shifted; something long and warm moved beneath. The mantle clock kept its slow, indifferent tick.

He pinched the seam; a puff of flour rose and whiskers brushed his skin. He drew a breath and said, "Flour on the seams, whiskers against my hand, that sour fur-musk—Grandmother's spectacles on a snout."

The nightcap drooped; the seam gave—a pair of spectacles slid down the long snout.

Silence.

The huntsman's jaw set. He lifted the spectacles between forefinger and thumb, held them to the light. "That's no elder's profile—it's a muzzle."

He set the spectacles down slowly. "If you were human, I could not do this. For beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

The wolf's purr tightened.

The Huntsman fires the arrow, and it flys true. Wolf slumps dead in the bed, with an arrow in the eye. 
The huntsman notices the moving belly of Wolf, and partly in shock, party in fascination, cuts wolf's belly open with his skinning knife. 
First Grandmother spills out—pale, blinking, shocked with breath and alive. Then Red, slick with Wolf’s remains.

END_TOUCHPOINT
BEGIN_RESULT
The room held its breath as the Huntsman drew, counted, and loosed. The arrow hummed through candle air and bedsheets and struck the wolf's eye; the wolf slumped, dead. The wolf's spectacles leapt; the nightcap flipped; flour rose like ash and settled on the quilt. The bed heaved once; the wolf shuddered and sank, jaw slack beneath the patchwork, the arrow shaft tilting toward the ceiling. The feathering trembled in the ruined eye; Grandmother's nightcap and spectacles lay askew on the pillow. Beneath the patchwork the belly still moved, round and slow, as if something trapped remembered air. Herb-sour breath pressed through the cloth.

The Huntsman turned back the quilt to the chin, exposing the ruined eye. He lowered the bow and set it against the hearthstones, drew a basin and laid towels on the stool. The Huntsman laid a steady palm on the wolf's belly and froze, breath low; curiosity and disbelief in equal measure. He rolled the body a hand's width to free the mattress, set the skinning knife to the seam, and cut, steady and economical.

A thin arm slipped through the rent—then Grandmother tumbled out first, pale, blinking, coughing the tea air and flour, alive and startled. The belly sagged flat; the quilt puddled around the ribs; the room’s shapes righted themselves. Red slid out next, slick with wolf's blood and flour dust. The Huntsman covered her hair with a towel, guided her to a chair, wrapped another about her shoulders, and steadied her feet. He wiped the knife on a cloth, checked Grandmother's breath and pulse, then checked Red's pulse and breathing. The cottage slowly remembered itself.

Grandmother smoothed her shawl and set a cup down. "Thank you, dear, for your help. Mind your boots—there's enough forest in my rug already. I'll see to the stove and rest a moment." Her fingers trembled slightly.

"Glad to help, ma'am," the huntsman said, shifting his weight.

Red tucked the basket under her arm, curtsied, and offered, "Please—take a bit of bread for the road," her eyes hopeful.

"No—keep it. You'll need it," he said. He inclined his head, shouldered his bow, and stepped toward the door. "Latch the door at dusk. The night keeps its own counsel." He checked the path once more.

The room eased; the clock's ticking sounded softer as they carried the wolf from the threshold. Warmth pooled by the stove; the cottage sighed as if it, too, could breathe again.

"Take care." He tipped his cap and stepped onto the path.

Grandmother murmured, "Bless you," and smoothed Red's hood as the smell of bread and jam rose from the table.

Grandmother and Red have tea, bread and jam.  The End.

END_TOUCHPOINT
BEGIN_RESULT
Red steps inside and hangs her red hood over the chair-back; Red's hood catches the late light and warms the chair. Red sets the basket of goodies on the table and watches Grandmother smooth the tablecloth; a floorboard answers with a small creak as the house settles around them. The clock on the mantel counts a steady beat.

"I brought bread and jam, Grandmother," Red says, clutching the basket and curtsying.

"Come in, dear," Grandmother answers, smiling.

Red lifts the lid of the basket and takes out the loaf, its crust split with a clean village cut. She slices two rounds, crumbs falling neat on the board. Butter softens under the knife's edge and the blade smooths the bread's face. Grandmother unwraps the jam and spreads it thick and glossy. Grandmother pours tea into two cups; porcelain answers with a thin chime. They lift the cups together and steam curls around their noses, drifting up toward the rafters.

"These will warm you, Grandmother," Red says.

They eat the bread and jam; the table takes the gentle thrum of their small motions. Before dusk fully fell, Red checked the latch once more, remembering the Huntsman's warning to latch the door at dusk.

"Stay a while, dear," Grandmother says.

Dusk leaned on the window until the day closed over the cottage; the clock's steady beat softened, and the house kept its small, reclaimed warmth.
