Red's point of view
Red had promised sweets and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow; she remembers the hush that settled when she stepped into Grandmother's neat room and the wrongness under the quilt, the candle crooked, the voice too smooth. There was a strangled sound she never quite placed until the huntsman came down the deer-track, bow lowering, tracks leading only to the sill—his arrival a cold certainty in the margin of the day. She felt the room tighten: the clock's stubborn tick, the teapot's false warmth, the flour dust that blew against her fingers when he pinched the seam. Then the arrow hummed and the wolf's purr stilled; flour fell like ash, the quilt gave, and she tumbled out slick with blood and dust into the sudden, domestic light. The Huntsman wrapped her, pressed towels and steady hands where terror had been, and with measured kindness set the house back to its small affairs—bread, jam, a smoothed shawl—while she hung her hood, split the crust, and let the ordinary motions stitch the tremor in her chest into something like safety.

Grandmother's point of view
Grandmother remembers the comfort of a visit promised—Red's bright hood, the basket's clatter—and then the soft, perfidious fill of her own bed as fur and false affection closed over her breath. She felt the village clock count while something heavy warmed her belly and the cottage answered in the voice of an impostor; then a sharpness—an arrow's note—tore the pretense open. She tumbled from the rent in the quilt coughing tea air and flour, bewildered and alive, tasting the room's return in the tang of jam set before her and the huntsman's steady, practical hands. She smoothed her shawl with fingers that trembled and, with a gentleness that reknitted the day, set out bread and jam as if to prove that the small, domestic rituals could reclaim not only a house but the shape of ordinary life itself.

Huntsman's point of view
The woods had given him a sound—a brief, strangled cry—and he left the ribbon of trail because anything that bled wrong in the pines demanded he follow. Tracks led him to the sill, not away, and the cottage's forced calm told him the house had been tricked; the teapot's cold ring, the dust-masked light, the mantle clock's indifferent tick. He circled, tested the jamb, and slipped inside with bow low, reading the air: fur-musk, flour, hearth-ash. The quilt betrayed a wrong fullness; a snout glinted, spectacles lay askew, whiskers brushed his skin when he pinched the seam. Duty sharpened his jaw. He set the arrow, judged the shot, and let it sing through linen to the wolf's eye. Flour rose, the false domesticity unraveled, and his knife opened a seam to give Grandmother and the child back to the room. He set towel and basin, checked breaths and pulses, refused the offered bread but left them with a warning—latch the door at dusk—and stepped back onto the path, the forest taking him again as the cottage sighed and steadied beneath his departing shadow.

Wolf's point of view
The wolf remembers the sweet, practiced ease of slipping a muzzle into a shawl and a lie into a voice, of chewing down a warm body to make a bed where the house would answer with kinship and a teapot's quiet. He felt the smell of the pines behind him, the cunning balance of flour to hide his tracks, and the jam-sweet promise that lured the child close; the masquerade was almost complete until a different hunter's presence shifted the room's air. He purred under the quilt to calm his prize, tasted powder when fingers found the seam, and felt the predator's calculus turn on him—eyes steady, bow drawn. The arrow found its mark; the domestic illusion splintered into flour and nightcap, the belly went slack, and where victory had seemed a warm, swallowed world he met cold steel and the sudden, unmistakable end, the cottage's breath returning as his fraud and appetite were stripped away.
