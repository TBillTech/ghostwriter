=== SYSTEM ===
Assign dialog lines to actors as 'id: line' entries.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

Her iconic red\nhood and basket are more than props—they’re little anchors of bravery when\nthe woods press close.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Wolf: “Closer, sweetheart,” the voice purls. “These old eyes don’t catch the light so well.”
Red: “Grandmother, what a big nose you have.”
Wolf: “The better to smell you with, my dear.”
Red: “And what big ears you have.”
Wolf: “The better to hear you with, my dear.”
Red: “And—your nails—how big they are.”
Wolf: “The better to grasp you with, my dear.”
Red: “Grandmother… what big teeth you have.”
Wolf: “The better to eat you with, my dear!”


# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* wolf: Closer, sweetheart; these old eyes don’t catch the light so well.
* red: Yes, Grandmother… I’ll come a little closer, please.
* red: Grandmother, what a big nose you have.
* wolf: The better to smell you with, my dear.
* red: And what big ears you have.
* wolf: The better to hear you with, my dear.
* red: And—your nails—how big they are, all shiny in the candlelight.
* wolf: The better to grasp you with, my dear.
* red: Grandmother… what big teeth you have.
* wolf: The better to eat you with, my dear!

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
wolf: You purr, "Closer, sweetheart; these old eyes don’t catch the light so well."

red: You step a fraction nearer and say, "Yes, Grandmother… I’ll come a little closer, please."

red: You tilt your head and ask, "Grandmother, what a big nose you have."

wolf: You answer with a silky smile, "The better to smell you with, my dear."

red: You blink and add, "And what big ears you have."

wolf: You draw the word out, "The better to hear you with, my dear."

red: You glance at the glinting nails and murmur, "And—your nails—how big they are, all shiny in the candlelight."

wolf: You let a low chuckle slip, "The better to grasp you with, my dear."

red: You falter at the doorway and whisper, "Grandmother… what big teeth you have."

wolf: You bare a grin and declare, "The better to eat you with, my dear!"
