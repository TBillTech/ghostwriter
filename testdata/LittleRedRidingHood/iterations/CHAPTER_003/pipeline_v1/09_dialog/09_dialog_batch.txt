CHARACTER DATA (reference for all ITEMS; do not repeat below):

=== CHARACTER: id=wolf ===
{
  "id": "wolf",
  "name": "The Wolf",
  "background": "A sleek, hungry trickster who prefers a silver tongue to a swift pounce.\nHe prowls the liminal places—where path meets bramble, where caution meets\ncuriosity. Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern\nand play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and\nshortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when\nthe woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.\n",

Agenda notes (focus for this scene):
* You speak to draw the other in, to reshape her choices by soft suggestion, and to make the environment bend to your plan.
* You want to speed outcomes that favor you: time, opportunity, and control; you want to be the quiet director of the exchange.
* You hide predatory intent beneath civility; your words are crafted to seem caring while they narrow options and test timing.
* You aim to sound composed and knowing for the recording: smooth, persuasive, with just enough playfulness to lower defenses.
* Your current mood is patient and delighting in the mechanism of persuasion—calm control mixed with a low, anticipatory hunger.
* You are motivated by advantage and secrecy; you avoid overt force in favor of charm and rhetorical pressure.
* In performance terms you seek to let menace be implied, never confessed, so that every compliment functions as a gentle constraint.

Agenda notes (focus for this scene):
* You speak because you must fulfill a duty entrusted to you and because politeness anchors you when uncertainty tugs.
* You also speak to test safety—each question is a small probe to confirm the world remains as you were taught.
* You want to reach the goal you were sent toward without shame or delay; you also want to protect yourself and comfort the other when possible.
* You try to be helpful and truthful; you hide the fact that curiosity sometimes outweighs obedience so you can learn or linger.
* You aim to keep your voice steady for the recording: to sound earnest, unthreatening, and credibly tender even as doubts nudge at you.
* Your current mood is earnest with an undercurrent of anxious curiosity—polite resolve peppered with a flutter of unease.
* You are motivated by love and promise-keeping; you are wary of deception and determined not to cause alarm.
* In performance terms you want clarity and simplicity—each line should read as a straightforward question from a trusting, slightly distracted heart.

red: Your nails catch the candlelight, gleaming long and sharp.
wolf: Closer still, my dear; I want to hear every whisper you guard.
red: Those nails gleam in the candlelight, long and sharp as claws.
wolf: A soft chuckle slips free; closer still, dear—the fear in your voice tastes sweetest.
red: Grandmother, those teeth look terribly large in this candlelight.
