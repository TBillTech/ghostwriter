- Remove the duplicate coaxing line: delete Wolf line "Wolf coaxed, 'Closer, dear; I'd hate to miss a single breath.'" (it repeats the opening "Closer, sweetheart" and flattens the Wolf's slyness).

- Replace the stage direction "the voice purls." with a brief, characterful delivery tag that shows the Wolf's sibilant, oily cadence without narrating action. Suggested replacement: attach the sibilant quality to the speech (e.g., render the line as spoken by Wolf with elongated sibilant: "Closer, sweetheart," the Wolf drawls, the sibilant sound lingering). (Purpose: keep voice quirks, avoid intrusive narration.)

- Tighten Wolf's first line punctuation/voice to emphasize charm and menace rather than literal failing eyesight. Keep the touch-point content "These old eyes don't catch the light so well." but consider making it a touch of flattery-manipulation: make it follow the sibilant delivery so it reads as part of the Wolf's lilt rather than an explanation. (Update rather than remove.)

- Make Red's lines slightly more character-consistent: change any heavy pauses or adult phrasing into simpler, earnest phrasing. Specifically, keep "Grandmother, what a big nose you have." and "Grandmother… what big teeth you have." but ensure the ellipsis on the final line reads like a child's hesitant observation (one short pause, not theatrical). (Update pacing.)

- Minor clarity tweak: change "And—your nails—how big they are." to "And—your nails—how big they are" only if you want to preserve the archaic phrasing; otherwise consider "And—your nails—how big they are." → "And your nails—how very big they are." (optional) Keep the child's literal tone; avoid wording that sounds like an adult describing actions.

- Ensure each reply from Wolf retains the exact touch-point refrain "my dear" and the pattern of escalating menace. Keep the four "The better to…" lines as given, but make the rhythm uniform: short, taut sentences without extra qualifiers.

- Remove any extra dialogue tags or adverbs elsewhere (e.g., "coaxed," "purls") that duplicate what the speech itself shows; prefer one small evocative tag (drawls, purrs, hisses) and let the words do the rest.

- Final pass: read the sequence aloud to confirm the Wolf's lines slither and the Red's lines stay simple and earnest; tweak punctuation to keep Red's literal naiveté (short clauses, plain words) and Wolf's theatrical, sibilant cadence.
