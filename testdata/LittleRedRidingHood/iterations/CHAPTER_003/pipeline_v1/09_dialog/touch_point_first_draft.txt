Wolf purred, "Come a little closer, darling; my old eyes miss nothing in the candlelight.."
Red stepped nearer, "Yes, Grandmother; I’ll come a little closer, please.."
Red tilted her head, "Grandmother, that nose seems unusually large.."
Wolf smiled silkily, "Closer, dear; I’d hate to miss a single breath under this glow.."
Red blinked once, "Your nails catch the candlelight, gleaming long and sharp.."
Wolf drawled, "Closer still, my dear; I want to hear every whisper you guard.."
Red studied nails, "Those nails gleam in the candlelight, long and sharp as claws.."
Wolf chuckled low, "A soft chuckle slips free; closer still, dear—the fear in your voice tastes sweetest.."
Red faltered, "Grandmother, those teeth look terribly large in this candlelight.."
Wolf bared a grin, "I grin; closer still, my dear—the nearer you come, the sweeter the feast will be.!"
