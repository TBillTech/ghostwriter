"Closer, sweetheart," the voice purls. "These old eyes don't catch the light so well."

Wolf coaxed, "Closer, dear; I'd hate to miss a single breath."

"Grandmother, what a big nose you have."

"The better to smell you with, my dear."

"And what big ears you have."

"The better to hear you with, my dear."

"And—your nails—how big they are."

"The better to grasp you with, my dear."

"Grandmother… what big teeth you have."

"The better to eat you with, my dear!"
