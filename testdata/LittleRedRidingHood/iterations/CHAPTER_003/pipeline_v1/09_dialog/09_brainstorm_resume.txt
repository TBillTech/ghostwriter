=== SYSTEM ===
Brainstorm dialog beats as bullet points.

=== USER ===
You are a creative writer working from structured YAML notes.  
Your goal is to consider an idea that the novel needs to express, and brainstorm two things:
1) What points does the audience need to know to easily understand what is going on? This adds clarity.
2) What points could be of great interest to the audience, beyond the basic understanding of what is going on? This adds flavor.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Inside, where thyme and cabbage sighed and Grandmother's clock ticked small and thin, he measured time by chimney smoke and the warm heat of the latch, tested the shape of his lies at the door, and let a soft, practiced knock fall like a coin into quiet. The house answered with a creak and a hesitant lift; the kettle sighed, curtains stirred, and in a single, smooth motion he sprang, swallowed the old woman whole, then set himself to tucking the room into the semblance of sleep: he steadied the chair, soothed the quilt, nudged the teapot back to a whisper, powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, practiced a smaller smile and a cough, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting so that when Red's step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with warm, measured voice and a doorway softened by the pretense of kin.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise and my nursery tune keeping my feet steady as the sun cut long stripes through the pines—but the lane ahead felt too quiet and my bright hood seemed to hurry me on. I had chosen the narrow deer-track with a wish to be quicker, humming of jam and bread on my lips, and though the wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edge of my memory, I did not see the cottage answer a different voice: I did not see the door yield to a softer knock, the kettle sigh and the latch lift, the way warm mint and ash breathed out like a secret. I imagined the room full and waiting, not the small convulsion of chair and quilt that followed a single swift movement, nor the hush that settled after a startled breath; I only held to the belief that my coming would be met with the familiar, measured voice I remember, and not yet the dimmed, private theatre the cottage has become.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, checked the shingles and found time enough before Red's footfalls, then tested the latch and let my voice smooth itself into a kinlier thing. I let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin, shaped Red’s breathy plea on my tongue, and when the latch clicked and warm mint and ash spilled out I made my move—a single, clean bound—and closed the small mouth of the house on the one who kept its day. The work afterward was careful and domestic: I righted the chair, nudged the saucer true, coaxed steam back into the teapot, powdered my muzzle, tugged on nightcap and spectacles, learned a smaller smile and a cough, drew the shutters to dim the light and folded the cottage into a private, dimmed theatre of welcome; I lay beneath the strawberry quilt like a borrowed story, tail tucked, clock’s tick loud as a metronome, waiting with silk and practiced concern for the bright hood at the threshold.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her small feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf uncoil from my bramble and pad through thyme and cabbage toward the cottage, tasting the jam that rides my air; he checked the lane, measured the sun on the shingles, scanned for witnesses, and let a practiced knock fall as soft as a coin. The cottage answered—latch clicking, kettle sighing, warm mint and ash spilling into the lane—and then it shuddered as chair and quilt moved and stillness reformed; the wolf leapt in a single, private motion and the house folded itself around a new occupant. I felt him smooth powder across his muzzle, tug the nightcap down, adjust spectacles, hook the shutters to thin the daylight into gray hush, and watched the room become a dim little theatre, its domestic sounds folded inward while dust trembled in a thin bar of light and the clock’s tick marked the waiting until her bright song would reach the door.

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
Thyme and tea rose from the kettle. A sour musk threaded the air near the bed — a scent that didn't belong to Grandmother. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry — or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Spectacles glinted wide on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap drooped too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its fold. The cap’s rim slipped lower when an ear-tip pressed and flattened beneath the knit, and the spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; something beneath the stitches breathed too deep.

The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly; the quilt rustled with a weight that did not belong to age. A small, oddly sweet voice came from beneath the quilt. The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where something heavier than bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. Red drew back a fraction, clutching the basket tighter, listening to the hush that followed the deeper breath.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Bedside Performance', 'description': 'The bed is drawn close to the window where the light is weakest. A figure nestles among quilts—nightcap pulled low, spectacles glinting faintly, whiskers powdered to a genteel gray.\nThe room narrows to the breath between them; each step Red takes is answered by a rustle under the quilt and a sugar-sweet murmur from the pillows.\n', 'props': [{'name': "Grandmother's Nightcap and Spectacles", 'significance': 'Disguise and distortion', 'description': 'The cap droops over pricked ears; the spectacles sit too wide on a long, shadowed muzzle.\n'}, {'name': 'Patchwork Quilt', 'significance': 'Concealment of claws and tail', 'description': 'A cheerful scatter of stitched flowers stretched tight over oddly angular shapes.\n'}, {'name': 'Candle Stub', 'significance': 'Faltering light to invite mistakes', 'description': 'A guttering wick that bends the shadows into kind shapes—and hides the sharp ones.\n'}, {'name': 'Basket of Goodies', 'significance': 'Bait within the trap', 'description': 'Set at the foot of the bed, its linen napkin puckers where something heavier than bread has jostled it.\n'}]}

# The Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point; This is the core idea that needs to be expounded upon:
Wolf: “Closer, sweetheart,” the voice purls. “These old eyes don’t catch the light so well.”
Red: “Grandmother, what a big nose you have.”
Wolf: “The better to smell you with, my dear.”
Red: “And what big ears you have.”
Wolf: “The better to hear you with, my dear.”
Red: “And—your nails—how big they are.”
Wolf: “The better to grasp you with, my dear.”
Red: “Grandmother… what big teeth you have.”
Wolf: “The better to eat you with, my dear!”



# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide all your brainstormed ideas as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character. Use only simple statements, NOT additional markdown.  Do NOT put dashes at the front of the lines.
2. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting.  
3. **Touch-Point**: Expressing this touch point creatively IS YOUR GOAL.  
4. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
5. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible, especially via character exclamations and reactions.

Now, brainstorm creative lines to give the readers clarity and flavor, with the goal of building upon and making the touch point real. Consider the probabilities of items up to 2 or 3 sigma in the sampled distribution (but do not make this explicit).
