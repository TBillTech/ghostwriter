=== SYSTEM ===
Produce an agenda list grouped by actor id.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help to concentrate on roleplaying.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know why they care enough to speak, and what the want. The actors also need to know what they are trying to get out of the interaction.

Her iconic red\nhood and basket are more than props—they’re little anchors of bravery when\nthe woods press close.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Red nudges the door and peers inside. “Grandmother?” she calls, the word softening in the warm air.
From the inner room, a cough answers, followed by a coaxing, “Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught.”
Red: “I brought the bread and jam. Are you resting?”
Wolf (as Grandmother): “So thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down and come kiss your old granny.”


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Motivation**: There must be some reason for the actors to say what they do.  Tell them what it is. 
3. **Desires**: List out things that the actor wants. Specifically explain if the actor is trying to hide a motive.
4. **Current Mood**: Explain the actors mood. If the actor is feeling good, explain this.  If the actor is angry at the facts of the situation, but loves the other character, explain this. The more nuanced the better.
5. **Format**: Each actor should generate one bullet list starting with the id of the character followed by a colon. After this, as many bullets as necessary to list the above items.  Do exactly ONE list for EACH character, and no more.
6. **Abstract**: Stick to abstract langauge. Describe mental states. DO NOT desccribe anything.

Below is an example showing input format given for four lines, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each entry is limited to a single name, like "Henry:" followed by a list of simple statements.  Do not put titles or markdown in the list of statements.

## Examples of actor prompt lines (3 lines):

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry:
* You love your wife Liza.
* You don't like being henpecked, but have gotten used to it over the years.
* You are frustrated because there is a hole in the bucket.
* You are always polite to your wife Liza. 
* You might even fix the bucket if you could.
* You know after all these years you cannot just say something like "we can't fix the bucket"
* Instead, you plan to gradually walk Liza through the whole problem.
* OK, who are you fooling, yeah, you'd rather be having a beer.

Liza:
* You think Henry is lazy.
* It is just a stupid bucket, and should not be a problem.
* You want Henry to show a little initiative and fix the bucket himself.
* You are very frustrated that Henry would even ask you something like this, instead of going ahead and solving the problem.
* You are in the habit of being polite just like Henry.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
Narrator: You brush the bright hood as the old latch yields, iron cold against your palm; the basket creaks like a small promise.

red: You call softly, "Grandmother?"

Narrator: You let the word soften into thyme-warm air; net curtains sieve the light into greenish pools; the clock’s timid tick grows bold.

wolf: You clear your throat and, in a papery, syrup-smooth voice, say, "A-hem—come in, dear heart. Mind the draught."

Narrator: You notice the voice is papery yet syrup-smooth; the quilted mound lies still as if holding its breath.

red: You tell them, "I bring the bread and jam!"

Narrator: You nudge the door wider with your hip, clutching the wicker; a faint chill curls past your ankles.

wolf: You purr, "Such a dutiful girl. Do shut the door, sweetling."

Narrator: You hear the latch sigh as it settles; a floorboard answers with a shy creak beneath your first step.

red: You ask, "You sound a little different… are you chilly?"

wolf: You murmur, "A touch, a touch—these rooms make echoes behind the lace."

Narrator: You watch the net curtains blur the bed’s outline; spectacles glint dull in the dim.

red: You offer, "Shall I open the shutters for more light?"

wolf: You protest softly, "Oh, no—no, child. The light pricks these old eyes."

Narrator: You hear the teapot whisper and rattle its lid like a nervous breath; the clock ticks between your small steps.

red: You ask, "May I put the basket on the table?"

wolf: You instruct, "Set it by the bed, pet, so I needn’t reach."

Narrator: You hesitate; the hood feels warm against your neck; your mother’s words tug at you, then loosen.

red: You say, "All right. Please don’t strain."

wolf: You reply, "Your kindness warms me more than fire."

red: You say, "I'll set the basket down right here— is that okay?"

wolf: You coo, "So thoughtful, my little bird. Now come kiss your old granny!"

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
red:
* Motivation: You speak because you must tend to a loved one and because uncertainty about the voice pulls at your compassion; calling aloud is a way to test that concern and to anchor yourself in duty.
* Desires: You want reassurance that the elder is all right; you want to deliver comfort and sustenance; you want to be obedient to instructions you were given; secretly you also want approval and to be seen as dependable.
* Hidden motive: Beneath politeness you seek confirmation that your choice to come was right and safe — a small hunger for affirmation you do not name aloud.
* Current mood: Gentle and earnest, threaded with curiosity and a soft anxiety; you oscillate between dutiful urgency and the small, disarming wonder that makes you linger; you remain polite even when unsettled.
* Tactical aim in the scene: Elicit truthful cues about the elder’s condition, secure permission to help, and maintain your moral course while resisting subtle pressure to stray from caution.

wolf:
* Motivation: You speak to shape the child’s choices, to lower her guard with warmth and flattery, and to steer the situation toward solitude and opportunity.
* Desires: You want compliance, access, and time — compliance to close doors and move in predictable directions, access to a private moment, and time to execute your plan; you prefer to hide your hunger and true intent beneath a mask of concern.
* Hidden motive: You conceal manipulation as care; any apology or softness is a tool to disarm, not a confession of feeling.
* Current mood: Smoothly amused and patient, a predator cloaked in civility; you feel confident in the leverage you’ve crafted and mildly entertained by the child’s literalness.
* Tactical aim in the scene: Cultivate trust quickly, nudge decisions that isolate and delay, and keep the child talking until the path you prefer is clear.
