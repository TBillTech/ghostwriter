The latch sighed. The cottage seemed to lean in as Red stepped inside, the basket creaking like a promise.

Net curtains sifted the afternoon light into greenish pools.

Red nudged the door and peered in. "Grandmother? It's Red. I brought bread and jam."

A cough answered from the inner room. "Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught."

His voice softened into a grandmotherly coo.

"Are you resting?" Red asked, clutching the basket.

"How thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down by the bed, and comeâ€”give your old granny a kiss."

Light trimmed the bed's silhouette. Nothing moved. Red hesitated, eyes dropping for a moment as she hummed the nursery tune under her breath, then stepped closer and reached toward the table. "May I put the basket on the table?" she asked.

"Set it by the bed, please, so I needn't reach," the voice purred.

"All right. Don't strain yourself," Red said, lowering the basket with careful hands.
