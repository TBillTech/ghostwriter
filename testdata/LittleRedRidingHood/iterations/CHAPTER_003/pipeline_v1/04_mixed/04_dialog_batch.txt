  "background": "A bright, tender-hearted village girl sent to bring food and comfort to her\nailing grandmother. She’s been warned to keep to the path and not speak to\nstrangers, but curiosity and kindness tug at her feet. She loves flowers,\nbirdsong, and the way sunlight freckles through the trees. Her iconic red\nhood and basket are more than props—they’re little anchors of bravery when\nthe woods press close.

Agenda notes (focus for this scene):
* Motivation: You speak because you must tend to a loved one and because uncertainty about the voice pulls at your compassion; calling aloud is a way to test that concern and to anchor yourself in duty.
* Desires: You want reassurance that the elder is all right; you want to deliver comfort and sustenance; you want to be obedient to instructions you were given; secretly you also want approval and to be seen as dependable.
* Hidden motive: Beneath politeness you seek confirmation that your choice to come was right and safe — a small hunger for affirmation you do not name aloud.
* Current mood: Gentle and earnest, threaded with curiosity and a soft anxiety; you oscillate between dutiful urgency and the small, disarming wonder that makes you linger; you remain polite even when unsettled.
* Tactical aim in the scene: Elicit truthful cues about the elder’s condition, secure permission to help, and maintain your moral course while resisting subtle pressure to stray from caution.

=== CHARACTER: id=wolf ===

  "id": "wolf",

  "background": "A sleek, hungry trickster who prefers a silver tongue to a swift pounce.\nHe prowls the liminal places—where path meets bramble, where caution meets\ncuriosity.

Agenda notes (focus for this scene):
* Motivation: You speak to shape the child’s choices, to lower her guard with warmth and flattery, and to steer the situation toward solitude and opportunity.
* Desires: You want compliance, access, and time — compliance to close doors and move in predictable directions, access to a private moment, and time to execute your plan; you prefer to hide your hunger and true intent beneath a mask of concern.
* Hidden motive: You conceal manipulation as care; any apology or softness is a tool to disarm, not a confession of feeling.
* Current mood: Smoothly amused and patient, a predator cloaked in civility; you feel confident in the leverage you’ve crafted and mildly entertained by the child’s literalness.
* Tactical aim in the scene: Cultivate trust quickly, nudge decisions that isolate and delay, and keep the child talking until the path you prefer is clear.

=== RESPONSE ===
Narrator: The latch sighs open and the cottage seems to lean in as Red steps inside, basket creaking with the weight of promises.
red: Grandmother, it is Red. I brought bread and jam to comfort you and to help you stay warm.
Narrator: Net curtains sift the afternoon light into greenish pools as the room seems to hold its breath, awaiting the elder's response.
wolf: Come in, dear heart; the draught is only the house breathing, and a moment by the fire will warm your hands and your questions.
Narrator: The clock's timid tick grows bolder, and the teapot's lid rattles as if a nervous breath accompanies Red's cautious pace.
red: I bring the bread and jam.
Narrator: The door sighs wider and the chill slips in as Red steadies the basket, watching the bed's silhouette for any sign of life.
wolf: Such a dutiful girl; please close the door, sweetling.
Narrator: Red's breath catches as the air thickens behind the net curtains, and the room waits with a quiet, measured patience.
red: You sound a little different, are you chilly?
wolf: A touch of chill, dear; these rooms remember every step and echo them back.
Narrator: Net curtains swallow the edges as the clock ticks, and Red's gaze drifts to the bed's faint outline, listening for any tremor of life.
red: Shall I open the shutters for more light?
wolf: Oh, no, child. The light pricks these old eyes.
Narrator: The stubborn light holds its edge as the bed's shape remains still, and the room listens for a whisper beyond the veil.
red: May I put the basket on the table?
wolf: Set it by the bed, please, so I needn’t reach.
Narrator: The basket slides toward the bed, and the room holds its breath as the exchange tilts toward a closer moment.
red: All right. Please don’t strain.
wolf: Your kindness warms me more than fire.
Narrator: I'll set the basket down right here— is that okay?
wolf: So thoughtful, my little bird; now come kiss your old granny.
