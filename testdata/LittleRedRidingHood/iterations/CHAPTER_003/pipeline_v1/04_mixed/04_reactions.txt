=== SYSTEM ===
Produce a reaction for each line, referencing the previous line.

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
The actors already know what to say, but you suspect they need help correctly roleplay their responses.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need more background to give their lines life.
The writer has already given you each of the lines that the actors will say.  Each actor line begins with the id field matching the character, followed by a colon, followed by the line spoken. The actors need to know how they will react to the previous statements.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Red nudges the door and peers inside. “Grandmother?” she calls, the word softening in the warm air.
From the inner room, a cough answers, followed by a coaxing, “Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught.”
Red: “I brought the bread and jam. Are you resting?”
Wolf (as Grandmother): “So thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down and come kiss your old granny.”


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and especially "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Reactions**: Supply a description of the reaction the character has to the previous line.  Note that if the previous line was said by the same actor, you need to provide the reaction of the character to the character's own line, as shown in the example. Focus entirely on what the other character said, and DO NOT say anything about the current character.
3. **Format**: Each actor line should generate a similiar line corresponding to it, describing the reaction of the character to the previous line.  Always put this in second person using the pronoun "you". For the first line, put: 
   You wonder what response you will get from your next words. 

Below is an example showing input format given for three bullets, showing the specific actor id and line direction:
Below that is an example output. When you produce your output, do not include anything in the output other than the syntax as given in the example. Each reaction should be formatted line the actor prompt lines.

## Examples of actor prompt lines:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Liza: You comment that most people would be done by now.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket sience, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

Liza: "With a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel dear Henry, dear Henry, with a dowel"

## Examples of Agenda output for each line:

Henry: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
Liza: You can't believe Henry is so lazy he won't fix the dang bucket without being asked!
Liza: You feel like what you just said is so obvious!
Henry: You feel like Liza is just being unreasonable and expecting too much.
Liza: You feel incredulous that using a dowel needs to be explained!

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you.
Narrator: You brush the bright hood as the old latch yields, iron cold against your palm; the basket creaks like a small promise.

red: You call softly, "Grandmother?"

Narrator: You let the word soften into thyme-warm air; net curtains sieve the light into greenish pools; the clock’s timid tick grows bold.

wolf: You clear your throat and, in a papery, syrup-smooth voice, say, "A-hem—come in, dear heart. Mind the draught."

Narrator: You notice the voice is papery yet syrup-smooth; the quilted mound lies still as if holding its breath.

red: You tell them, "I bring the bread and jam!"

Narrator: You nudge the door wider with your hip, clutching the wicker; a faint chill curls past your ankles.

wolf: You purr, "Such a dutiful girl. Do shut the door, sweetling."

Narrator: You hear the latch sigh as it settles; a floorboard answers with a shy creak beneath your first step.

red: You ask, "You sound a little different… are you chilly?"

wolf: You murmur, "A touch, a touch—these rooms make echoes behind the lace."

Narrator: You watch the net curtains blur the bed’s outline; spectacles glint dull in the dim.

red: You offer, "Shall I open the shutters for more light?"

wolf: You protest softly, "Oh, no—no, child. The light pricks these old eyes."

Narrator: You hear the teapot whisper and rattle its lid like a nervous breath; the clock ticks between your small steps.

red: You ask, "May I put the basket on the table?"

wolf: You instruct, "Set it by the bed, pet, so I needn’t reach."

Narrator: You hesitate; the hood feels warm against your neck; your mother’s words tug at you, then loosen.

red: You say, "All right. Please don’t strain."

wolf: You reply, "Your kindness warms me more than fire."

red: You say, "I'll set the basket down right here— is that okay?"

wolf: You coo, "So thoughtful, my little bird. Now come kiss your old granny!"

## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format with third person identity narratives.

=== RESPONSE ===
Narrator: You wonder what response you will get from your next words.
red: You feel the latch cold under your palm and the basket's small promise tighten your need to be received.
Narrator: You let the softened word settle and listen for how the room answers—curious which small sound will come next.
wolf: You note the cough and the papery syrup in the voice and think how easily a coaxing question will draw you further in.
Narrator: You register the quilted mound's stillness and hold your breath with the house, waiting for a sign of life.
red: You take comfort that the basket's duty is known; the voice above the bed seems to accept your purpose.
Narrator: You feel the door give and the chill slip in, and you watch how the room will make that chill belong to someone.
wolf: You sense the clutch at the wicker and know a gentle command will settle those nervous hands.
Narrator: You listen for the floorboard's shy answer and watch which small sound will claim the next moment.
red: You notice a shift in the voice and worry at the change, weighing whether concern or disguise hides there.
wolf: You hear the hint of a chill and think an excuse about echoes will soothe any edge of suspicion.
Narrator: You watch the bed's outline blur and pick up on the small, telling shine of spectacles—details that braid truth or falsehood.
red: You offer light as a practical kindness and feel for how the room might receive the clearer view.
wolf: You take the offer of shutters as an opening and craft a gentle refusal to keep the scene dim and pliable.
Narrator: You let the teapot and clock mark the tempo and note how small beats shape the comfort of a room.
red: You frame a simple question about the basket's place and test whether help will be welcomed or redirected.
wolf: You request the basket closer and measure how obedience colors the visit.
Narrator: You sense hesitation at the bed and the tug of remembered rules, and you wait to see which will win.
red: You respond with warmth and a plea against strain, listening to whether your care is returned.
wolf: You accept the kindness as fuel, and you let the praise make the child's charity feel like triumph.
red: You ask permission about the basket's placement and watch for the tone that will command or coax.
wolf: You feel the cooing praise as an invitation and anticipate the contact you have summoned.
