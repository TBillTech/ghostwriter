You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
Red nudges the door and peers inside. “Grandmother?” she calls, the word softening in the warm air.
From the inner room, a cough answers, followed by a coaxing, “Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught.”
Red: “I brought the bread and jam. Are you resting?”
Wolf (as Grandmother): “So thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down and come kiss your old granny.”


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
The latch sighed. The cottage seemed to lean in as Red stepped inside, the basket creaking like a promise.

Net curtains sifted the afternoon light into greenish pools.

Red nudged the door and peered in. "Grandmother? It's Red. I brought bread and jam."

A cough answered from the inner room. "Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught."

His voice softened into a grandmotherly coo.

"Are you resting?" Red asked, clutching the basket.

"How thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down by the bed, and come—give your old granny a kiss."

Light trimmed the bed's silhouette. Nothing moved. Red hesitated, eyes dropping for a moment as she hummed the nursery tune under her breath, then stepped closer and reached toward the table. "May I put the basket on the table?" she asked.

"Set it by the bed, please, so I needn't reach," the voice purred.

"All right. Don't strain yourself," Red said, lowering the basket with careful hands.

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove or rework one of the two "basket" images to avoid repetition (either drop "the basket creaking like a promise" or the later "lowering the basket with careful hands"). Keep the stronger image and delete the weaker.

- Replace "Net curtains sifted the afternoon light into greenish pools." with a shorter, more immediate sensory beat that ties to Red's perception (e.g., note the sun freckling the floor or a small motes-of-dust image). Avoid the oddly colored "greenish pools."

- Change "His voice softened into a grandmotherly coo." — this is clumsy and tells rather than shows. Instead, show the voice's wrongness: e.g., "The voice softened, too smooth by half—grandmotherly on the edge." Or: "A voice cooed from the bed—too slick, too practiced." (Keeps mystery that it's the Wolf.)

- Tighten the exchange about where to set the basket:
  - Make the Wolf's line more in-character: coaxing, flattering and subtly manipulative (use phrasing that echoes Red's words back to her and elongates sibilants). Example rewrite suggestion (not literal text required): "How thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down by the bed—do come closer, won't you?" — then Red replies.
  - Remove the clunky clause "so I needn't reach" and replace with a short, suggestive phrase from the Wolf that invites Red nearer (see above).

- Adjust Red's reply "All right. Don't strain yourself," — it reads oddly practical and adult. Make it more in-voice: polite, literal, and caring but a little naive. Suggest: "All right. Please don't try to sit up." or "All right. Let me set it close so you won't have to move."

- Add one or two tiny action beats to break the dialogue and ground the scene:
  - After Red hesitates, show a small, telling physical detail (she tucks a lock of hair back, clutches her hood, sniffs the air, or notices the bed's shape is wrong). Keep it subtle and short—this will heighten tension without losing momentum.
  - Example beats: a soft hum trailing off; a momentary sniff of something too sweet; Red noticing the bedclothes lie unnaturally smooth.

- Trim the line "Light trimmed the bed's silhouette. Nothing moved." into a single, sharper sentence that combines atmosphere and unease (e.g., "Light cut the bed's silhouette; stillness answered."), then follow immediately with Red's hesitation beat.

- Avoid explicit explanation that the speaker is the Wolf in disguise; instead, let the dialogue carry the wrongness. Remove any narratorial labels that identify the voice as male ("His voice...") or wolf unless you want to reveal. If you must keep a subtle hint, use sensory cues (breath that smells of the wood, a too-low chuckle) rather than naming the speaker.

- Ensure cadence/lexicon match:
  - Keep Red's lines short, polite, literal, and earnest (add "please"/"thank you" if needed).
  - Make the Wolf's lines slippier and more flattering—have him mirror Red's words once to build trust.

- Final pass: read the scene aloud to check rhythm; cut any remaining duplicated emotional beats (hesitation + humming + long description) so the scene stays taut and suspenseful.
