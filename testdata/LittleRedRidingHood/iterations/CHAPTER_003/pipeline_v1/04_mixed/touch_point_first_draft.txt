The latch sighs open and the cottage seems to lean in as Red steps inside, basket creaking with the weight of promises.
Red called softly, "Grandmother, it is Red. I brought bread and jam to comfort you and to help you stay warm.?"
Net curtains sift the afternoon light into greenish pools as the room seems to hold its breath, awaiting the elder's response.
Wolf cleared his throat, "Come in, dear heart; the draught is only the house breathing, and a moment by the fire will warm your hands and your questions.."
The clock's timid tick grows bolder, and the teapot's lid rattles as if a nervous breath accompanies Red's cautious pace.
Red chirped, "I bring the bread and jam.!"
The door sighs wider and the chill slips in as Red steadies the basket, watching the bed's silhouette for any sign of life.
Wolf purred, "Such a dutiful girl; please close the door, sweetling.."
Red's breath catches as the air thickens behind the net curtains, and the room waits with a quiet, measured patience.
Red asked, "You sound a little different, are you chilly??"
Wolf murmured, "A touch of chill, dear; these rooms remember every step and echo them back.."
Net curtains swallow the edges as the clock ticks, and Red's gaze drifts to the bed's faint outline, listening for any tremor of life.
Red offered, "Shall I open the shutters for more light??"
Wolf protested softly, "Oh, no, child. The light pricks these old eyes.."
The stubborn light holds its edge as the bed's shape remains still, and the room listens for a whisper beyond the veil.
Red asked, "May I put the basket on the table??"
Wolf instructed, "Set it by the bed, please, so I needn’t reach.."
The basket slides toward the bed, and the room holds its breath as the exchange tilts toward a closer moment.
Red reassured, "All right. Please don’t strain.."
Wolf replied, "Your kindness warms me more than fire.."
I'll set the basket down right here— is that okay?
Wolf cooed, "So thoughtful, my little bird; now come kiss your old granny.!"
