=== SYSTEM ===
Assign lines to actors as 'id: line' entries (Narrator allowed for brief prose beats).

=== USER ===
You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose to go into a novel.
Your job is to tell the actors what to say.  The actors know what their characters are like, but they need to be prompted as if they forgot their lines.
The writer has already given you each line that needs to be said, but didn't tell us which actors should say what, and the voice should be cast to second person.  Each line (bullet point) which needs to be spoken by an actor starts with a '*' character.

# Specifics in the Chapter
Here is central theme of the dialog lines being "filmed"/"recorded":
Red nudges the door and peers inside. “Grandmother?” she calls, the word softening in the warm air.
From the inner room, a cough answers, followed by a coaxing, “Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught.”
Red: “I brought the bread and jam. Are you resting?”
Wolf (as Grandmother): “So thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down and come kiss your old granny.”


# Rules for generation:
1. **Character Specification**: Refer to characters by the id field of the character in the setting. Each line must start with the id of the best character to speak it. 
2. **Narrator**: Some lines cannot easily be conveyed to a reader as dialog.  You should use "Narrator:" to assign lines that would be strange for any of the characters to say.
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Character Dialog**: When you tell the actor what to say, be sure to transform the words into second person, using the "you" pronoun. This helps the character role play and not get distracted by other points of view. 
5. **Multi-way Dialog**: Prefer switching which character says what on each successive line, if possible.  Sometimes, a character has to have two lines in a row, but this can get confusing for the reader. If you are tempted to have the same character say two consecutive dialogs, consider if one line should be Narrator.
6. **Avoid**: DO NOT put - or * at the beginning of the line. DO NOT add any other text or markdown other than the name, colon, and line. 

## Examples of actor prompt lines

Below is an example showing the format desired for three bullets, showing both the identity narration bits, followed by the specific actor id and line direction:

Henry: You say there is a hole in the bucket.  You use Liza's name several times for emphasis.  But you are careful to be polite.

Liza: You shortly tell Henry to just fix the dang thing!  Already!  Politely of course.

Narrator: Liza points her finger directly at the bucket hole.

Henry: You ask how on earth to fix a bucket? Maybe it is not rocket science, but you don't think you have a way to do it.

# Lines from the Writer:
These are the lines the writer is giving you. Note that there should always be one actor line output per bullet:
* Narrator: Ivy brushes the bright hood as the old latch yields, iron cold against her palm; the basket creaks like a small promise.
* red: "Grandmother?"
* Narrator: The word softens into thyme-warm air; net curtains sieve the light into greenish pools; the clock’s timid tick grows bold.
* wolf: "A-hem—come in, dear heart. Mind the draught."
* Narrator: The voice is papery yet syrup-smooth; the quilted mound lies still as if holding its breath.
* red: "I bring bread and jam!"
* Narrator: She nudges the door wider with her hip, clutching the wicker; a faint chill curls past her ankles.
* wolf: "Such a dutiful girl. Do shut the door, sweetling."
* Narrator: The latch sighs as it settles; a floorboard answers with a shy creak under her first step.
* red: "You sound a little different… are you chilly?"
* wolf: "A touch, a touch—these rooms make echoes behind the lace."
* Narrator: The net curtains blur the bed’s outline; spectacles glint dull in the dim.
* red: "Shall I open the shutters for more light?"
* wolf: "Oh, no—no, child. The light pricks these old eyes."
* Narrator: The teapot whispers and rattles its lid like a nervous breath; the clock ticks between her small steps.
* red: "May I put the basket on the table?"
* wolf: "Set it by the bed, pet, so I needn’t reach."
* Narrator: She hesitates; the hood feels warm against her neck; her mother’s words tug at her, then loosen.
* red: "All right. Please don’t strain."
* wolf: "Your kindness warms me more than fire."
* Red: “I'll set the basket down right here is that OK?”
* Wolf: “So thoughtful, my little bird. Now come kiss your old granny!”


## Job to do
Now, convert each line from the writer to the new actor centric second person format. Notice that you are always allowed to assign a line to the Narrator, but try not to do it unless you cannot see how to make it into a line of dialog. 

=== RESPONSE ===
Narrator: You brush the bright hood as the old latch yields, iron cold against your palm; the basket creaks like a small promise.

red: You call softly, "Grandmother?"

Narrator: You let the word soften into thyme-warm air; net curtains sieve the light into greenish pools; the clock’s timid tick grows bold.

wolf: You clear your throat and, in a papery, syrup-smooth voice, say, "A-hem—come in, dear heart. Mind the draught."

Narrator: You notice the voice is papery yet syrup-smooth; the quilted mound lies still as if holding its breath.

red: You tell them, "I bring the bread and jam!"

Narrator: You nudge the door wider with your hip, clutching the wicker; a faint chill curls past your ankles.

wolf: You purr, "Such a dutiful girl. Do shut the door, sweetling."

Narrator: You hear the latch sigh as it settles; a floorboard answers with a shy creak beneath your first step.

red: You ask, "You sound a little different… are you chilly?"

wolf: You murmur, "A touch, a touch—these rooms make echoes behind the lace."

Narrator: You watch the net curtains blur the bed’s outline; spectacles glint dull in the dim.

red: You offer, "Shall I open the shutters for more light?"

wolf: You protest softly, "Oh, no—no, child. The light pricks these old eyes."

Narrator: You hear the teapot whisper and rattle its lid like a nervous breath; the clock ticks between your small steps.

red: You ask, "May I put the basket on the table?"

wolf: You instruct, "Set it by the bed, pet, so I needn’t reach."

Narrator: You hesitate; the hood feels warm against your neck; your mother’s words tug at you, then loosen.

red: You say, "All right. Please don’t strain."

wolf: You reply, "Your kindness warms me more than fire."

red: You say, "I'll set the basket down right here— is that okay?"

wolf: You coo, "So thoughtful, my little bird. Now come kiss your old granny!"
