# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Inside, where thyme and cabbage sighed and Grandmother's clock ticked small and thin, he measured time by chimney smoke and the warm heat of the latch, tested the shape of his lies at the door, and let a soft, practiced knock fall like a coin into quiet. The house answered with a creak and a hesitant lift; the kettle sighed, curtains stirred, and in a single, smooth motion he sprang, swallowed the old woman whole, then set himself to tucking the room into the semblance of sleep: he steadied the chair, soothed the quilt, nudged the teapot back to a whisper, powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, practiced a smaller smile and a cough, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting so that when Red's step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with warm, measured voice and a doorway softened by the pretense of kin.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise and my nursery tune keeping my feet steady as the sun cut long stripes through the pines—but the lane ahead felt too quiet and my bright hood seemed to hurry me on. I had chosen the narrow deer-track with a wish to be quicker, humming of jam and bread on my lips, and though the wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edge of my memory, I did not see the cottage answer a different voice: I did not see the door yield to a softer knock, the kettle sigh and the latch lift, the way warm mint and ash breathed out like a secret. I imagined the room full and waiting, not the small convulsion of chair and quilt that followed a single swift movement, nor the hush that settled after a startled breath; I only held to the belief that my coming would be met with the familiar, measured voice I remember, and not yet the dimmed, private theatre the cottage has become.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, checked the shingles and found time enough before Red's footfalls, then tested the latch and let my voice smooth itself into a kinlier thing. I let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin, shaped Red’s breathy plea on my tongue, and when the latch clicked and warm mint and ash spilled out I made my move—a single, clean bound—and closed the small mouth of the house on the one who kept its day. The work afterward was careful and domestic: I righted the chair, nudged the saucer true, coaxed steam back into the teapot, powdered my muzzle, tugged on nightcap and spectacles, learned a smaller smile and a cough, drew the shutters to dim the light and folded the cottage into a private, dimmed theatre of welcome; I lay beneath the strawberry quilt like a borrowed story, tail tucked, clock’s tick loud as a metronome, waiting with silk and practiced concern for the bright hood at the threshold.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her small feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf uncoil from my bramble and pad through thyme and cabbage toward the cottage, tasting the jam that rides my air; he checked the lane, measured the sun on the shingles, scanned for witnesses, and let a practiced knock fall as soft as a coin. The cottage answered—latch clicking, kettle sighing, warm mint and ash spilling into the lane—and then it shuddered as chair and quilt moved and stillness reformed; the wolf leapt in a single, private motion and the house folded itself around a new occupant. I felt him smooth powder across his muzzle, tug the nightcap down, adjust spectacles, hook the shutters to thin the daylight into gray hush, and watched the room become a dim little theatre, its domestic sounds folded inward while dust trembled in a thin bar of light and the clock’s tick marked the waiting until her bright song would reach the door.

# Prior paragraph
This is only for context. Do NOT repeat this:
The latch sighed. The cottage seemed to lean in as Red stepped inside, the basket creaking like a promise.

Net curtains sifted the afternoon light into greenish pools.

Red nudged the door and peered in. "Grandmother? It's Red. I brought bread and jam."

A cough answered from the inner room. "Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught."

His voice softened into a grandmotherly coo.

"Are you resting?" Red asked, clutching the basket.

"How thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down by the bed, and come—give your old granny a kiss."

Light trimmed the bed's silhouette. Nothing moved. Red hesitated, eyes dropping for a moment as she hummed the nursery tune under her breath, then stepped closer and reached toward the table. "May I put the basket on the table?" she asked.

"Set it by the bed, please, so I needn't reach," the voice purred.

"All right. Don't strain yourself," Red said, lowering the basket with careful hands.

# Scene
Here is the scene they actors are placed in:
{'name': 'Bedside Performance', 'description': 'The bed is drawn close to the window where the light is weakest. A figure nestles among quilts—nightcap pulled low, spectacles glinting faintly, whiskers powdered to a genteel gray.\nThe room narrows to the breath between them; each step Red takes is answered by a rustle under the quilt and a sugar-sweet murmur from the pillows.\n', 'props': [{'name': "Grandmother's Nightcap and Spectacles", 'significance': 'Disguise and distortion', 'description': 'The cap droops over pricked ears; the spectacles sit too wide on a long, shadowed muzzle.\n'}, {'name': 'Patchwork Quilt', 'significance': 'Concealment of claws and tail', 'description': 'A cheerful scatter of stitched flowers stretched tight over oddly angular shapes.\n'}, {'name': 'Candle Stub', 'significance': 'Faltering light to invite mistakes', 'description': 'A guttering wick that bends the shadows into kind shapes—and hides the sharp ones.\n'}, {'name': 'Basket of Goodies', 'significance': 'Bait within the trap', 'description': 'Set at the foot of the bed, its linen napkin puckers where something heavier than bread has jostled it.\n'}]}

# Rules for generation:
1. **Bullet Points**: Provide your results as bullet points, starting the line with '*' character.
2. **Clean Lines**: If there are intent words at the beginning of the given bullets, for example "Clarity - ", or "Flavor: " leave those out and just recover the point without a title.
3. **Just Bullets Output**: Strip off, ignore, and do not output any markdown or other formatting, other than just only '*' character at line start.

Now, Here are the Bullets to be ordered in as logical a way as possible:
* Thyme and tea breathe from the kettle, but a sour musk threads the air near the bed.
* The nightcap on the bedpost hangs too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its droop.
* Powder dusts the pillow in a careless crescent, as if shaken by a rougher hand.
* Spectacles glint wide on a long shadow where the candle stub gutters.
* The patchwork quilt is stretched neat, yet shows angles that do not match an old frame.
* The chair by the hearth sits nudged askew, half turned, as if a body rose too quickly.
* Ash in the grate is smudged across the hearthstone in a hurried brush.
* The curtain’s hem still sways, though the window is latched and the air is still.
* The cap’s rim slips lower as an ear-tip presses and then flattens under the knit.
* The spectacles ride farther down, framing a muzzle’s bridge rather than a nose.
* red leans in as if to kiss, then halts when the quilt rustles in a heavier way.
* The figure pats the coverlet invitingly, a broad shape rising and falling under the patchwork.

* The chair by the hearth sits nudged askew, half turned, as if a body rose too quickly.
* Ash in the grate is smudged across the hearthstone in a hurried brush.
* A guttering wick bends the light; shadows pool where the room should be brightest.
* Spectacles glint wide on a long shadow where the candle stub gutters.
* The nightcap on the bedpost hangs too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its droop.
* The cap’s rim slips lower as an ear-tip presses and then flattens under the knit.

* Powder dusts the pillow in a careless crescent, as if shaken by a rougher hand.
* The patchwork quilt is stretched neat, yet shows angles that do not match an old frame.
* The bed’s silhouette looks a little off—too angular, as if something else crouches beneath the stitches.
* The figure pats the coverlet invitingly, a broad shape rising and falling under the patchwork.
* The quilt rustles in a heavier way than an old woman’s breath should make.
* A pocket of warmth and a false voice wait beneath the fabric, folded into a private theatre.
* The basket sits at the foot of the bed, linen napkin puckered where something heavier has shifted.
* Red leans in as if to kiss, then halts when the quilt rustles in a heavier way.
* She draws back a fraction, clutching the basket tighter, listening to the quiet that follows the heavier breath.
