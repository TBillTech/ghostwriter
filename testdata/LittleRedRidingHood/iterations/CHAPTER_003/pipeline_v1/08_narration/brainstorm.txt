* Thyme and tea breathe from the kettle, but a sour musk threads the air near the bed.
* The nightcap on the bedpost hangs too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its droop.
* Powder dusts the pillow in a careless crescent, as if shaken by a rougher hand.
* Spectacles glint wide on a long shadow where the candle stub gutters.
* The patchwork quilt is stretched neat, yet shows angles that do not match an old frame.
* The chair by the hearth sits nudged askew, half turned, as if a body rose too quickly.
* Ash in the grate is smudged across the hearthstone in a hurried brush.
* The curtain’s hem still sways, though the window is latched and the air is still.
* The cap’s rim slips lower as an ear-tip presses and then flattens under the knit.
* The spectacles ride farther down, framing a muzzle’s bridge rather than a nose.
* red leans in as if to kiss, then halts when the quilt rustles in a heavier way.
* The figure pats the coverlet invitingly, a broad shape rising and falling under the patchwork.
