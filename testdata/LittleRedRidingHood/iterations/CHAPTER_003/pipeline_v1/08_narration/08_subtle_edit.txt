You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Inside, where thyme and cabbage sighed and Grandmother's clock ticked small and thin, he measured time by chimney smoke and the warm heat of the latch, tested the shape of his lies at the door, and let a soft, practiced knock fall like a coin into quiet. The house answered with a creak and a hesitant lift; the kettle sighed, curtains stirred, and in a single, smooth motion he sprang, swallowed the old woman whole, then set himself to tucking the room into the semblance of sleep: he steadied the chair, soothed the quilt, nudged the teapot back to a whisper, powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, practiced a smaller smile and a cough, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting so that when Red's step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with warm, measured voice and a doorway softened by the pretense of kin.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise and my nursery tune keeping my feet steady as the sun cut long stripes through the pines—but the lane ahead felt too quiet and my bright hood seemed to hurry me on. I had chosen the narrow deer-track with a wish to be quicker, humming of jam and bread on my lips, and though the wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edge of my memory, I did not see the cottage answer a different voice: I did not see the door yield to a softer knock, the kettle sigh and the latch lift, the way warm mint and ash breathed out like a secret. I imagined the room full and waiting, not the small convulsion of chair and quilt that followed a single swift movement, nor the hush that settled after a startled breath; I only held to the belief that my coming would be met with the familiar, measured voice I remember, and not yet the dimmed, private theatre the cottage has become.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, checked the shingles and found time enough before Red's footfalls, then tested the latch and let my voice smooth itself into a kinlier thing. I let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin, shaped Red’s breathy plea on my tongue, and when the latch clicked and warm mint and ash spilled out I made my move—a single, clean bound—and closed the small mouth of the house on the one who kept its day. The work afterward was careful and domestic: I righted the chair, nudged the saucer true, coaxed steam back into the teapot, powdered my muzzle, tugged on nightcap and spectacles, learned a smaller smile and a cough, drew the shutters to dim the light and folded the cottage into a private, dimmed theatre of welcome; I lay beneath the strawberry quilt like a borrowed story, tail tucked, clock’s tick loud as a metronome, waiting with silk and practiced concern for the bright hood at the threshold.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her small feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf uncoil from my bramble and pad through thyme and cabbage toward the cottage, tasting the jam that rides my air; he checked the lane, measured the sun on the shingles, scanned for witnesses, and let a practiced knock fall as soft as a coin. The cottage answered—latch clicking, kettle sighing, warm mint and ash spilling into the lane—and then it shuddered as chair and quilt moved and stillness reformed; the wolf leapt in a single, private motion and the house folded itself around a new occupant. I felt him smooth powder across his muzzle, tug the nightcap down, adjust spectacles, hook the shutters to thin the daylight into gray hush, and watched the room become a dim little theatre, its domestic sounds folded inward while dust trembled in a thin bar of light and the clock’s tick marked the waiting until her bright song would reach the door.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
A sour musk threads beneath the thyme and tea. The cap on the bedpost is tugged too low; powder dusts the pillow in a careless crescent.
The chair by the hearth is nudged askew, as if someone left it in a hurry—or made it look as though they hadn’t. Red begins to act visibly nervous.
Red edges closer, maybe to give her "Grandmother" a kiss, but she begins to hesitate. The figure pats the coverlet invitingly.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
Thyme and tea rose from the kettle, but something sour threaded the air near the bed, a musk that did not belong to Grandmother. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth sat nudged askew, half turned as if someone had left it in a hurry. Ash smudged the hearthstone in a hurried brush, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Spectacles glinted wide on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap on the bedpost drooped too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its fold. The cap’s rim slipped lower as an ear-tip pressed and flattened under the knit, and the spectacles rode farther down, framing a muzzle’s bridge rather than Grandmother’s nose. Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet its angles did not match an old frame—the bed’s silhouette looked too angular, as if something else crouched beneath the stitches.

The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly; a broad shape rose and fell in a rhythm heavier than Grandmother’s breath should make. The quilt rustled with a weight that did not belong to age, and warmth pooled there with a voice folded small and sweet into the covers, like a private theatre waiting for the next act. The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where something heavier than bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that heavier way. Red drew back a fraction, clutching the basket tighter, listening to the hush that followed the heavy breath.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Tone down explicit animal reveal (e.g., "muzzle’s bridge") to preserve eerie ambiguity. Replace with a more suggestive phrase: "where Grandmother’s nose should be, something too sharp/too tapered showed" or "a bridge that read wrong for a face."
- Erase the cap-on-bedpost detail: The cap is on the Wolf, not the bedpost.
- Emphasize the sour musk as foreign to Grandmother up front: change "something sour threaded the air near the bed, a musk that did not belong to Grandmother" to "a sour musk threaded the air near the bed — a scent that didn’t belong to Grandmother."
- Clarify and tighten the chair detail to match touch-point: change "the chair by the hearth sat nudged askew, half turned as if someone had left it in a hurry" to "the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry — or made to look so."
- Reduce over-descriptive or metaphor-heavy lines that blur tension (e.g., "private theatre waiting for the next act"); replace with a taut sensory image: "a voice folded small and sweet into the covers" → keep only "a small, oddly sweet voice came from beneath the quilt."
- Soften or remove any over-specific bodily descriptors implying the Wolf unmasked (e.g., "crouched beneath the stitches," "broad shape rose and fell in a rhythm heavier than Grandmother’s breath should make") — rephrase to suggest wrongness, not reveal. Example: "the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; something beneath the stitches breathed too deep."
- Fix small pronoun ambiguities: specify subjects instead of starting sentences with "The cap’s rim slipped lower as an ear-tip pressed..." — change to "The cap’s rim slipped lower when an ear-tip pressed and flattened beneath the knit."
- Trim or rework redundant motion descriptions to tighten pacing (e.g., "Ash smudged the hearthstone in a hurried brush" + "the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled...") — combine into one sharper line: "Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest."
- Optional: if you want to keep the writer’s playful quirks, retain one striking metaphor but anchor it in sensory detail so it doesn't deflate tension (e.g., keep "spectacles glinted" but cut anything that explains too much).

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.
