Thyme and tea rose from the kettle. A sour musk threaded the air near the bed — a scent that didn't belong to Grandmother. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry — or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Spectacles glinted wide on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap drooped too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its fold. The cap’s rim slipped lower when an ear-tip pressed and flattened beneath the knit, and the spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; something beneath the stitches breathed too deep.

The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly; the quilt rustled with a weight that did not belong to age. A small, oddly sweet voice came from beneath the quilt. The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where something heavier than bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. Red drew back a fraction, clutching the basket tighter, listening to the hush that followed the deeper breath.
