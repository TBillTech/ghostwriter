- Make the sour musk explicitly under/behind the thyme-and-tea scent in the first sentence: change order/phrasing so "a sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea" appears early (matches touch-point).
- Tighten opening sensory lines to avoid mild repetition (e.g., prune either "rose from the kettle" or "threaded the air" and keep the clearer image).
- Clarify ambiguous referents: replace vague "it" and "something" with concrete nouns where possible (e.g., "spectacles glinted" → "Grandmother’s spectacles glinted" only if you mean the impostor is wearing them; otherwise say "the spectacles on the pillow glinted").
- Reword the cap/ear detail to make agency clear and match touch-point: "the cap on the bedpost is tugged too low" → show the rim tugged low by an ear-tip flattened beneath the knit (e.g., "the nightcap had been tugged too low, an ear-tip flattened beneath its fold").
- Preserve the powder-on-pillow crescent but tighten: change "Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand" to a shorter, sharper line that reads as evidence (e.g., "Powder scored the pillow in a careless crescent, as if a clumsy hand had knocked it").
- Make the chair detail crisper and less duplicated: keep one strong line like "the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry—or made to look so" and remove the near-duplicate later.
- Ground the wrongness of the bed/body with specific, non-mystical detail (avoid "something beneath the stitches breathed too deep" unless you want suggestion): either make it plainly the Wolf (allowed) or use a clearer sensory cue (e.g., "the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother").
- Attribute the small, oddly sweet voice to the Wolf (speaker must be one of the two): change "A small, oddly sweet voice came..." to "A small, oddly sweet voice—soft as a purr—rose; the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother."
- Ensure any dialogue or vocal mimicry uses the Wolf's sly cadence/techniques (repeat Red's words back, sprinkle flattery) to keep character consistent.
- Show Red’s nervousness with concrete actions tied to the touch-point: add a micro-beat where Red "edges closer, pauses with the basket at her knees, glances at the cap, then hesitates before the kiss" and emphasize visible nervous ticks (clutching basket, a swallowed breath, fingers fumbling napkin).
- Replace "The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly" with an active line that signals invitation plus wrongness and speaker: e.g., "The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet, patting with a deliberate, inviting rhythm that felt rehearsed — then the Wolf's voice coaxed, 'Come closer, dear.'"
- Remove or recast overly florid/ambiguous metaphors that obscure evidence (e.g., "shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest" is fine; avoid multiple high-fall words in one sentence).
- Keep narrator distance consistent: decide whether details (spectacles, powder, chair) are seen by Red or omniscient narrator and phrase accordingly so Red's physical reactions line up with what she can observe.
- Double-check that no huntsman/foreshadowing details are hinted at or named; keep any external pursuit only vaguely suggested or omitted.
