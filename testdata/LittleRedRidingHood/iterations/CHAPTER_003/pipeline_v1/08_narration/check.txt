You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
A huntsman is tracking after wolf.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
A sour musk threads beneath the thyme and tea. The cap on the bedpost is tugged too low; powder dusts the pillow in a careless crescent.
The chair by the hearth is nudged askew, as if someone left it in a hurry—or made it look as though they hadn’t. Red begins to act visibly nervous.
Red edges closer, maybe to give her "Grandmother" a kiss, but she begins to hesitate. The figure pats the coverlet invitingly.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
Thyme and tea rose from the kettle. A sour musk threaded the air near the bed — a scent that didn't belong to Grandmother. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry — or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Spectacles glinted wide on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap drooped too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its fold. The cap’s rim slipped lower when an ear-tip pressed and flattened beneath the knit, and the spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; something beneath the stitches breathed too deep.

The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly; the quilt rustled with a weight that did not belong to age. A small, oddly sweet voice came from beneath the quilt. The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where something heavier than bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. Red drew back a fraction, clutching the basket tighter, listening to the hush that followed the deeper breath.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Make the sour musk explicitly under/behind the thyme-and-tea scent in the first sentence: change order/phrasing so "a sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea" appears early (matches touch-point).
- Tighten opening sensory lines to avoid mild repetition (e.g., prune either "rose from the kettle" or "threaded the air" and keep the clearer image).
- Clarify ambiguous referents: replace vague "it" and "something" with concrete nouns where possible (e.g., "spectacles glinted" → "Grandmother’s spectacles glinted" only if you mean the impostor is wearing them; otherwise say "the spectacles on the pillow glinted").
- Reword the cap/ear detail to make agency clear and match touch-point: "the cap on the bedpost is tugged too low" → show the rim tugged low by an ear-tip flattened beneath the knit (e.g., "the nightcap had been tugged too low, an ear-tip flattened beneath its fold").
- Preserve the powder-on-pillow crescent but tighten: change "Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand" to a shorter, sharper line that reads as evidence (e.g., "Powder scored the pillow in a careless crescent, as if a clumsy hand had knocked it").
- Make the chair detail crisper and less duplicated: keep one strong line like "the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry—or made to look so" and remove the near-duplicate later.
- Ground the wrongness of the bed/body with specific, non-mystical detail (avoid "something beneath the stitches breathed too deep" unless you want suggestion): either make it plainly the Wolf (allowed) or use a clearer sensory cue (e.g., "the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother").
- Attribute the small, oddly sweet voice to the Wolf (speaker must be one of the two): change "A small, oddly sweet voice came..." to "A small, oddly sweet voice—soft as a purr—rose; the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother."
- Ensure any dialogue or vocal mimicry uses the Wolf's sly cadence/techniques (repeat Red's words back, sprinkle flattery) to keep character consistent.
- Show Red’s nervousness with concrete actions tied to the touch-point: add a micro-beat where Red "edges closer, pauses with the basket at her knees, glances at the cap, then hesitates before the kiss" and emphasize visible nervous ticks (clutching basket, a swallowed breath, fingers fumbling napkin).
- Replace "The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly" with an active line that signals invitation plus wrongness and speaker: e.g., "The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet, patting with a deliberate, inviting rhythm that felt rehearsed — then the Wolf's voice coaxed, 'Come closer, dear.'"
- Remove or recast overly florid/ambiguous metaphors that obscure evidence (e.g., "shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest" is fine; avoid multiple high-fall words in one sentence).
- Keep narrator distance consistent: decide whether details (spectacles, powder, chair) are seen by Red or omniscient narrator and phrase accordingly so Red's physical reactions line up with what she can observe.
- Double-check that no huntsman/foreshadowing details are hinted at or named; keep any external pursuit only vaguely suggested or omitted.
