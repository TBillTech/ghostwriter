Thyme and tea rose from the kettle, but something sour threaded the air near the bed, a musk that did not belong to Grandmother. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth sat nudged askew, half turned as if someone had left it in a hurry. Ash smudged the hearthstone in a hurried brush, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Spectacles glinted wide on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap on the bedpost drooped too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its fold. The cap’s rim slipped lower as an ear-tip pressed and flattened under the knit, and the spectacles rode farther down, framing a muzzle’s bridge rather than Grandmother’s nose. Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet its angles did not match an old frame—the bed’s silhouette looked too angular, as if something else crouched beneath the stitches.

The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly; a broad shape rose and fell in a rhythm heavier than Grandmother’s breath should make. The quilt rustled with a weight that did not belong to age, and warmth pooled there with a voice folded small and sweet into the covers, like a private theatre waiting for the next act. The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where something heavier than bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that heavier way. Red drew back a fraction, clutching the basket tighter, listening to the hush that followed the heavy breath.
