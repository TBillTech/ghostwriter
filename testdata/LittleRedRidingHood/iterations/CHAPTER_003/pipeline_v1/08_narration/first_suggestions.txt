- Tone down explicit animal reveal (e.g., "muzzle’s bridge") to preserve eerie ambiguity. Replace with a more suggestive phrase: "where Grandmother’s nose should be, something too sharp/too tapered showed" or "a bridge that read wrong for a face."
- Erase the cap-on-bedpost detail: The cap is on the Wolf, not the bedpost.
- Emphasize the sour musk as foreign to Grandmother up front: change "something sour threaded the air near the bed, a musk that did not belong to Grandmother" to "a sour musk threaded the air near the bed — a scent that didn’t belong to Grandmother."
- Clarify and tighten the chair detail to match touch-point: change "the chair by the hearth sat nudged askew, half turned as if someone had left it in a hurry" to "the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry — or made to look so."
- Reduce over-descriptive or metaphor-heavy lines that blur tension (e.g., "private theatre waiting for the next act"); replace with a taut sensory image: "a voice folded small and sweet into the covers" → keep only "a small, oddly sweet voice came from beneath the quilt."
- Soften or remove any over-specific bodily descriptors implying the Wolf unmasked (e.g., "crouched beneath the stitches," "broad shape rose and fell in a rhythm heavier than Grandmother’s breath should make") — rephrase to suggest wrongness, not reveal. Example: "the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; something beneath the stitches breathed too deep."
- Fix small pronoun ambiguities: specify subjects instead of starting sentences with "The cap’s rim slipped lower as an ear-tip pressed..." — change to "The cap’s rim slipped lower when an ear-tip pressed and flattened beneath the knit."
- Trim or rework redundant motion descriptions to tighten pacing (e.g., "Ash smudged the hearthstone in a hurried brush" + "the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled...") — combine into one sharper line: "Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest."
- Optional: if you want to keep the writer’s playful quirks, retain one striking metaphor but anchor it in sensory detail so it doesn't deflate tension (e.g., keep "spectacles glinted" but cut anything that explains too much).
