"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

The clock on the mantle ticked, then stuttered one beat late; the teapot lid chattered once on a thin puff of steam. The candle’s flame bowed and the bedframe gave a short, splintering creak. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered under it; powdered whiskers plumed in a dusty puff against the paneled gloom. Wolf’s spectacles skewed and the nightcap slipped, exposing pricked ears. A hand—no, a paw—hooked the quilt’s edge; claws caught and lifted the hem. The patchwork flowers rippled like water as something moved beneath. Wolf surged from the quilts; the patchwork flowers rippled again. Wolf opened wide; teeth flashed in the bent light and breath fogged the lenses, then washed them clear. Red jolted back; Red’s heel skidded and the basket tilted and clicked on the floorboard. Red’s scream cut the room; the clock swallowed the next tick.

Wolf burped a small, careful cough into the sleeve; the candle steadied to a thin bead of fire. The patchwork lay smooth again, now fuller; a new roundness moved beneath. Inside Wolf’s belly, Red found Grandmother folded there, and the house held its breath and waited. The room closed back to hush; the clock resumed its ticking.
