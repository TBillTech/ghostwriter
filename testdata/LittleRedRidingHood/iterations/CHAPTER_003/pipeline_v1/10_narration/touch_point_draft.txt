"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

The clock on the mantle ticked, then stuttered one tick late; the teapot lid chattered once on a thin puff of steam. The candle’s flame bowed and the bedframe gave a short, splintering creak. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it; a paw hooked the edge. Powdered whiskers plumed in a dusty puff against the paneled gloom. The patchwork flowers rippled like water as something moved under the stitches. Wolf surged from the quilts; the patchwork gave a sharper, hollow tug. His breath fogged the spectacles, then wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh. Red jolted back; her heel skidded and the basket tilted against the floorboard. Her scream cut the room; the clock swallowed the next tick. The quilt yawned like a mouth; then it swallowed her.

Wolf smoothed his sleeve and exhaled, a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead of fire. The patchwork quilt lay smooth again, fuller at the hip; a new roundness shifted beneath the stitches. Inside Wolf’s belly, Red found Grandmother folded there, and the house fell quiet and waited. The clock resumed its ticking.
