You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies to her ailing grandmother and walked the forest path humming a nursery tune, the bright hood over her head catching sunbeams as pine needles softened her steps and pale dust lifted behind her while a wicker basket creaked like a small, steady promise; tufted blue flowers bowed at the verge, the jam-sweet scent threaded the air, and the hood shone against tall, shadowed pines as the trail bent around an oak and deepened into hush. The sleek wolf had slid from the bramble to shadow her, honeyed in speech and flattering in suggestion, and when she, though hesitant, took the narrow deer-track he offered, he slipped ahead with a private purpose. He reached the cottage while the forest kept its breath—checked the sun on the shingles, listened for footfalls, and found the lane empty—and with a practiced calm he knocked, mimicked the granddaughter’s voice, and bade the old latch be lifted. Inside, where thyme and cabbage sighed and Grandmother's clock ticked small and thin, he measured time by chimney smoke and the warm heat of the latch, tested the shape of his lies at the door, and let a soft, practiced knock fall like a coin into quiet. The house answered with a creak and a hesitant lift; the kettle sighed, curtains stirred, and in a single, smooth motion he sprang, swallowed the old woman whole, then set himself to tucking the room into the semblance of sleep: he steadied the chair, soothed the quilt, nudged the teapot back to a whisper, powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, practiced a smaller smile and a cough, and arranged the dim room into a private theatre of waiting so that when Red's step and song finally neared, the cottage would answer with warm, measured voice and a doorway softened by the pretense of kin.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise and my nursery tune keeping my feet steady as the sun cut long stripes through the pines—but the lane ahead felt too quiet and my bright hood seemed to hurry me on. I had chosen the narrow deer-track with a wish to be quicker, humming of jam and bread on my lips, and though the wolf's velvet questions still curl at the edge of my memory, I did not see the cottage answer a different voice: I did not see the door yield to a softer knock, the kettle sigh and the latch lift, the way warm mint and ash breathed out like a secret. I imagined the room full and waiting, not the small convulsion of chair and quilt that followed a single swift movement, nor the hush that settled after a startled breath; I only held to the belief that my coming would be met with the familiar, measured voice I remember, and not yet the dimmed, private theatre the cottage has become.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patience sat easy beneath my coat as I slipped through thyme and cabbage, tasting the jam that rode the air; I watched her bright hood cut the light and timed my words like a blade, checked the shingles and found time enough before Red's footfalls, then tested the latch and let my voice smooth itself into a kinlier thing. I let a practiced knock fall soft as a coin, shaped Red’s breathy plea on my tongue, and when the latch clicked and warm mint and ash spilled out I made my move—a single, clean bound—and closed the small mouth of the house on the one who kept its day. The work afterward was careful and domestic: I righted the chair, nudged the saucer true, coaxed steam back into the teapot, powdered my muzzle, tugged on nightcap and spectacles, learned a smaller smile and a cough, drew the shutters to dim the light and folded the cottage into a private, dimmed theatre of welcome; I lay beneath the strawberry quilt like a borrowed story, tail tucked, clock’s tick loud as a metronome, waiting with silk and practiced concern for the bright hood at the threshold.

Forest Path's point of view
I cradle the pale dust behind her small feet and hold the sunbeams in narrow bands as she hums beneath my pines, and I watched the wolf uncoil from my bramble and pad through thyme and cabbage toward the cottage, tasting the jam that rides my air; he checked the lane, measured the sun on the shingles, scanned for witnesses, and let a practiced knock fall as soft as a coin. The cottage answered—latch clicking, kettle sighing, warm mint and ash spilling into the lane—and then it shuddered as chair and quilt moved and stillness reformed; the wolf leapt in a single, private motion and the house folded itself around a new occupant. I felt him smooth powder across his muzzle, tug the nightcap down, adjust spectacles, hook the shutters to thin the daylight into gray hush, and watched the room become a dim little theatre, its domestic sounds folded inward while dust trembled in a thin bar of light and the clock’s tick marked the waiting until her bright song would reach the door.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The final phrase "the better to eat you with!" is the classic jump scare!
The quilt bunches as muscles bunch beneath it. A hand—no, a paw?—hooks the quilt’s edge.
The clock stutters one tick late; the teapot lid chatters once. 
Red screams, and is sent to join her Grandmother in the belly of the beast.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

The clock on the mantle ticked, then stuttered one beat late; the teapot lid chattered once on a thin puff of steam. The candle’s flame bowed and the bedframe gave a short, splintering creak. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered under it; powdered whiskers plumed in a dusty puff against the paneled gloom. Wolf’s spectacles skewed and the nightcap slipped, exposing pricked ears. A hand—no, a paw—hooked the quilt’s edge; claws caught and lifted the hem. The patchwork flowers rippled like water as something moved beneath. Wolf surged from the quilts; the patchwork flowers rippled again. Wolf opened wide; teeth flashed in the bent light and breath fogged the lenses, then washed them clear. Red jolted back; Red’s heel skidded and the basket tilted and clicked on the floorboard. Red’s scream cut the room; the clock swallowed the next tick.

Wolf burped a small, careful cough into the sleeve; the candle steadied to a thin bead of fire. The patchwork lay smooth again, now fuller; a new roundness moved beneath. Inside Wolf’s belly, Red found Grandmother folded there, and the house held its breath and waited. The room closed back to hush; the clock resumed its ticking.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace "Wolf burped a small, careful cough into the sleeve" with something less comic and more menacing (e.g., "Wolf smoothed his sleeve and exhaled, a small, satisfied sound") to preserve tone and threat.

- Remove the duplicate "the patchwork flowers rippled" phrasing; vary description so each motion escalates (first ripple, then a sharper tug or a hollow thud).

- Clarify quilt antecedent where ambiguous: change "The patchwork lay smooth again, now fuller; a new roundness moved beneath." to "The patchwork quilt lay smooth again, fuller at the hip; a new roundness shifted beneath the stitches." (avoids vague "patchwork")

- Tighten pronoun use for Red: avoid repeating "Red" in close succession. Example: "Red jolted back; her heel skidded and the basket tilted against the floorboard." (use "her" once)

- Make the clock/teapot beats explicit and precisely ordered to match the touch-point: ensure the sequence reads "the clock stuttered one tick late; the teapot lid chattered once" (the draft already has this but confirm exact phrasing and placement immediately before quilt movement).

- Emphasize the quilt-as-muscle image once and then move immediately to the paw hook to heighten the jump: combine into one crisp line (e.g., "The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it; a paw hooked the edge.").

- Replace "breath fogged the lenses, then washed them clear" with a tighter image anchored to the Wolf: "His breath fogged the spectacles, then wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh." (keeps action tied to Wolf)

- Soften "the room closed back to hush" which is awkward—change to "the room fell into a waiting hush" or "the house fell quiet and waited."

- Preserve the final shock (Red is sent into the belly) but make the collapse more immediate and visceral: show the moment Red is consumed rather than summarizing. Example instruction: add one short sentence after the scream that shows the quilt swallowing Red (e.g., "The quilt yawned like a mouth; then it swallowed her.").

- Ensure no mention or hint of the huntsman or other actors and that only Red and Wolf speak or act in the scene; remove or reword any stray lines that could imply outside rescue.

- Re-check lyrical voice: keep the writer's vivid flourishes but cut small, comic asides (like "burped") and redundant sensory clauses to sharpen the jump-scare timing.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.
