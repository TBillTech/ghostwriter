* The clock on the mantle ticks, then stutters one beat late.
* The teapot lid chatters once on a thin puff of steam.
* The quilt bunches as muscles gather under it.
* A hand—no, a paw—hooks the quilt’s edge; claws catch and lift the hem.
* The spectacles skew; the nightcap slips and exposes pricked ears.
* Powdered whiskers plume in a dusty puff against the paneled gloom.
* The candle’s flame bows; the bedframe gives a short, splintering creak.
* wolf surges from the quilts; the patchwork flowers ripple like water.
* red jolts back; her heel skids; the basket tilts and clicks on the floorboard.
* wolf opens wide; teeth flash in the bent light; breath fogs the lenses and washes them clear.
* red’s scream cuts the room; the clock swallows the next tick.
* The patchwork lies smooth again, now fuller; a new, roundness moves beneath.
* wolf burps a small, careful cough into the sleeve; the candle steadies to a thin bead of fire.
* The room closes back to hush; the clock resumes its ticking.
* Inside wolf’s belly, red joins Grandmother; the house holds its breath and waits.
