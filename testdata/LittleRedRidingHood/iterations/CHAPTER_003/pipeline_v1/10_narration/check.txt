You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
Thyme and tea rose from the kettle. A sour musk threaded the air near the bed — a scent that didn't belong to Grandmother. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry — or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Spectacles glinted wide on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap drooped too low, hiding pricked shapes beneath its fold. The cap’s rim slipped lower when an ear-tip pressed and flattened beneath the knit, and the spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder dusted the pillow in a careless crescent, as if knocked by a rougher hand. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; something beneath the stitches breathed too deep.

The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet invitingly; the quilt rustled with a weight that did not belong to age. A small, oddly sweet voice came from beneath the quilt. The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where something heavier than bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. Red drew back a fraction, clutching the basket tighter, listening to the hush that followed the deeper breath.

---

"Closer, sweetheart," the voice purls. "These old eyes don't catch the light so well."

Wolf coaxed, "Closer, dear; I'd hate to miss a single breath."

"Grandmother, what a big nose you have."

"The better to smell you with, my dear."

"And what big ears you have."

"The better to hear you with, my dear."

"And—your nails—how big they are."

"The better to grasp you with, my dear."

"Grandmother… what big teeth you have."

"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
A huntsman is tracking after wolf.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
The final phrase "the better to eat you with!" is the classic jump scare!
The quilt bunches as muscles bunch beneath it. A hand—no, a paw?—hooks the quilt’s edge.
The clock stutters one tick late; the teapot lid chatters once. 
Red screams, and is sent to join her Grandmother in the belly of the beast.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

The clock on the mantle ticked, then stuttered one tick late; the teapot lid chattered once on a thin puff of steam. The candle’s flame bowed and the bedframe gave a short, splintering creak. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it; a paw hooked the edge. Powdered whiskers plumed in a dusty puff against the paneled gloom. The patchwork flowers rippled like water as something moved under the stitches. Wolf surged from the quilts; the patchwork gave a sharper, hollow tug. His breath fogged the spectacles, then wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh. Red jolted back; her heel skidded and the basket tilted against the floorboard. Her scream cut the room; the clock swallowed the next tick. The quilt yawned like a mouth; then it swallowed her.

Wolf smoothed his sleeve and exhaled, a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead of fire. The patchwork quilt lay smooth again, fuller at the hip; a new roundness shifted beneath the stitches. Inside Wolf’s belly, Red found Grandmother folded there, and the house fell quiet and waited. The clock resumed its ticking.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Replace vague subjects with names in key beats: change any opening sentences that begin with "The clock..." or "The candle..." to lead with "Red" or "Wolf" when their perceptions/actions matter (e.g., "Red heard the clock stutter..." / "Wolf's breath fogged the spectacles...") to remove ambiguity and keep focalization tight.

- Tighten the jump-scare cadence: shorten the few sentences before the final swallow so the rhythm accelerates—make the clock stutter, teapot chatter, quilt bunch, paw hook, Red's scream, then the swallow—each as sharp, single images. Remove or condense intermediary lines that slow momentum (e.g., "The candle’s flame bowed and the bedframe gave a short, splintering creak").

- Clarify agency on the spectacles: make it explicit that Wolf fogged then wiped them ("Wolf's breath fogged the spectacles; he wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh") so the actions read as the Wolf's theatrical mannerism rather than anonymous happenings.

- Rework the awkward "the patchwork gave a sharper, hollow tug": replace with a clearer, stronger image tied to the Wolf or the quilt ("the patchwork tugged sharp and hollow as Wolf surged") to avoid passive or confusing phrasing.

- Preserve the child’s point-of-view immediacy in the swallowing line: keep Red-centered verbs (e.g., "Red screamed; the quilt yawned like a mouth — then closed over her") rather than letting the narrator drop too far away before the swallow.

- Remove or rephrase the overly serene aftermath lines that undercut horror and agency: cut or stiffen "Wolf smoothed his sleeve and exhaled, a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied..." to something more in keeping with the Wolf's theatrical menace (e.g., "Wolf smoothed his sleeve with a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead.") — avoid peaceful phrasing like "fell quiet and waited."

- Make the "inside the belly" beat more visceral but not explicit about other actors: change "Inside Wolf’s belly, Red found Grandmother folded there" to a tighter sensory image from Red's (or an omniscient) angle that implies being joined without overexplaining (e.g., "Warm dark folded around her—Grandmother's shawl pressed against Red's cheek"), so it satisfies the touch-point without drifting into flat exposition.

- Delete or trim the line "The clock resumed its ticking." If you keep it, place it as a closing punctuation that echoes the jump-scare (one short sentence) and avoid giving the scene a lull; otherwise the image feels tonal-softening.

- Watch mixed metaphors and tonal shifts: remove lines that flip between whimsical simile and clinical statement in the same sentence (e.g., "The patchwork flowers rippled like water as something moved under the stitches") — pick a single, strong image and lean into it.

- Preserve voice quirks: keep at least one Wolf mannerism (elongated sibilant or "purls") in the immediate pre- or post-swallower line to maintain theatrical menace, and retain Red's physical reactions (clutching basket, heel skidded) but compress them into fewer, sharper beats.
