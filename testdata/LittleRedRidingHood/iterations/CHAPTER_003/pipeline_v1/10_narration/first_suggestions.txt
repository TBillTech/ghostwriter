- Replace "Wolf burped a small, careful cough into the sleeve" with something less comic and more menacing (e.g., "Wolf smoothed his sleeve and exhaled, a small, satisfied sound") to preserve tone and threat.

- Remove the duplicate "the patchwork flowers rippled" phrasing; vary description so each motion escalates (first ripple, then a sharper tug or a hollow thud).

- Clarify quilt antecedent where ambiguous: change "The patchwork lay smooth again, now fuller; a new roundness moved beneath." to "The patchwork quilt lay smooth again, fuller at the hip; a new roundness shifted beneath the stitches." (avoids vague "patchwork")

- Tighten pronoun use for Red: avoid repeating "Red" in close succession. Example: "Red jolted back; her heel skidded and the basket tilted against the floorboard." (use "her" once)

- Make the clock/teapot beats explicit and precisely ordered to match the touch-point: ensure the sequence reads "the clock stuttered one tick late; the teapot lid chattered once" (the draft already has this but confirm exact phrasing and placement immediately before quilt movement).

- Emphasize the quilt-as-muscle image once and then move immediately to the paw hook to heighten the jump: combine into one crisp line (e.g., "The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it; a paw hooked the edge.").

- Replace "breath fogged the lenses, then washed them clear" with a tighter image anchored to the Wolf: "His breath fogged the spectacles, then wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh." (keeps action tied to Wolf)

- Soften "the room closed back to hush" which is awkwardâ€”change to "the room fell into a waiting hush" or "the house fell quiet and waited."

- Preserve the final shock (Red is sent into the belly) but make the collapse more immediate and visceral: show the moment Red is consumed rather than summarizing. Example instruction: add one short sentence after the scream that shows the quilt swallowing Red (e.g., "The quilt yawned like a mouth; then it swallowed her.").

- Ensure no mention or hint of the huntsman or other actors and that only Red and Wolf speak or act in the scene; remove or reword any stray lines that could imply outside rescue.

- Re-check lyrical voice: keep the writer's vivid flourishes but cut small, comic asides (like "burped") and redundant sensory clauses to sharpen the jump-scare timing.
