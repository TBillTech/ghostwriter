Red nudges the door and peers inside. “Grandmother?” she calls, the word softening in the warm air.
From the inner room, a cough answers, followed by a coaxing, “Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught.”
Red: “I brought the bread and jam. Are you resting?”
Wolf (as Grandmother): “So thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down and come kiss your old granny.”

The latch sighed. The cottage seemed to lean in as Red stepped inside, the basket creaking like a promise.

Sun freckled the floor.

Red nudged the door and peered in. "Grandmother? It's Red. I brought bread and jam."

A cough answered from the inner room. "Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught." The voice cooed—too slick, too practiced.

"Are you resting?" Red asked, clutching the basket.

"How thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down by the bed—do come closer, won't you?"

Light cut the bed's silhouette; stillness answered. She hesitated, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear. The hum trailed off. Then she stepped closer and reached toward the table. "May I put it on the table?" she asked.

"Set it by the bed—do come closer," the voice purred.

"All right. Let me set it close so you won't have to move."

A sour musk threads beneath the thyme and tea. The cap on the bedpost is tugged too low; powder dusts the pillow in a careless crescent.

Red edges closer, maybe to give her "Grandmother" a kiss, but she begins to hesitate. The figure pats the coverlet invitingly.

A sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea rising from the kettle. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched, and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry—or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Grandmother’s spectacles glinted on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap had been tugged too low, an ear-tip flattened beneath its fold. The spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder scored the pillow in a careless crescent, as if a clumsy hand had knocked it. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother.

The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where a weight heavier than the bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet in a deliberate, inviting rhythm; the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother—small, oddly sweet, soft as a purr. "Come closer, dear," it coaxed. Red edged nearer, paused with the basket at her knees, glanced at the cap, and swallowed; her fingers tightened on the handle and the napkin puckered between her palms as she listened to the hush and the too-deep breaths.

Red: “Grandmother, what a big nose you have.”
Wolf: “The better to smell you with, my dear.”

Wolf: “The better to hear you with, my dear.”
Red: “And—your nails—how big they are.”

The final phrase "the better to eat you with!" is the classic jump scare!
The quilt bunches as muscles bunch beneath it. A hand—no, a paw?—hooks the quilt’s edge.
The clock stutters one tick late; the teapot lid chatters once. 
Red screams, and is sent to join her Grandmother in the belly of the beast.

"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

Red heard the clock on the mantle stutter one tick late. The teapot lid chattered once. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it. A paw hooked the edge. Wolf's breath fogged the spectacles; he wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh, powdered whiskers pluming into the gloom. Red jolted back, her heel skidding as the basket tilted against the floorboard. She screamed; the quilt yawned like a mouth—then closed over her.

Wolf smoothed his sleeve with a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead. Warm dark folded around Red—Grandmother's shawl pressed against her cheek—and a low, sibilant purl threaded the stitches. A single tick answered.
