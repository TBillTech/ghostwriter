You are an evaluator extracting actionable suggestions only.

=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Your job is to verify the passage aligns with the touch-point, character personalities, and setting, while keeping a healthy balance: crisp dialog lines, and brief narrative/action sentences where needed to paint the picture or advance motion.

Watch for the following:
* Redundancy and repetition—call out lines that repeat the same idea and should be trimmed.
* Wrong balance—if there are long prose sections crowding out dialog, recommend shortening; if dialog lacks needed action context, recommend inserting brief narrative beats.
* Weird constructions—e.g., characters describing their own actions in first person instead of letting narration carry it; overly literal symbols (“symbolizing …”). Prefer subtlety and implication.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should generally not be stated outright; prefer subtle hints. If they are explicit, flag it:


# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog portions:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the core idea to realize through a mix of dialog and narrative action. Avoid hammering it directly; let it emerge:
Red nudges the door and peers inside. “Grandmother?” she calls, the word softening in the warm air.
From the inner room, a cough answers, followed by a coaxing, “Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught.”
Red: “I brought the bread and jam. Are you resting?”
Wolf (as Grandmother): “So thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down and come kiss your old granny.”


# The Draft
The mixed draft (dialog + brief narration) to be evaluated is as follows:
The latch sighed. The cottage seemed to lean in as Red stepped inside, the basket creaking like a promise.

Sun freckled the floor.

Red nudged the door and peered in. "Grandmother? It's Red. I brought bread and jam."

A cough answered from the inner room. "Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught." The voice cooed—too slick, too practiced.

"Are you resting?" Red asked, clutching the basket.

"How thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down by the bed—do come closer, won't you?"

Light cut the bed's silhouette; stillness answered. She hesitated, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear. The hum trailed off. Then she stepped closer and reached toward the table. "May I put it on the table?" she asked.

"Set it by the bed—do come closer," the voice purred.

"All right. Let me set it close so you won't have to move."

Now, suggest specific improvements: lines to remove, add, or update; places to tighten or expand, and how to improve the dialog/action balance without losing momentum.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove the duplicate line: cut the second "Set it by the bed—do come closer." (its repetition flattens tension).
- Replace "The latch sighed. The cottage seemed to lean in as Red stepped inside, the basket creaking like a promise." with a tighter sensory beat: e.g., "The latch sighed. The cottage leaned in; the basket creaked." (keeps mood, trims flourish).
- Collapse "Sun freckled the floor." into the previous sentence or expand it into a sensory line that ties to Red's perspective (she notices the sunlight on the floorboards) to avoid a disconnected fragment.
- Remove the narrator's parenthetical judgement "The voice cooed—too slick, too practiced." and instead show the Wolf's mimicry through wording and cadence in the dialogue (so suspicion grows from sound and phrasing, not the narrator telling the reader).
- Alter the Wolf's lines to show slyness through phrasing:
  - Change "Come in, dear heart. Mind the draught." → "Come in, dear heart... mind the draught," (stretch syllables, trailing ellipsis) or add a small sibilant flourish so the line reads as imitation rather than sincerity.
  - Change "How thoughtful, my little bird. Set it down by the bed—do come closer, won't you?" to something that echoes Red's own words and flatters—e.g., "How thoughtful, my little bird. Lay it close to me—come nearer now." (repeats "my little bird" and softens into coaxing).
- Tighten Red's replies to match her cadence and mannerisms: change "Are you resting? Red asked, clutching the basket." to "Are you resting? she asked, fingers tightening on the basket." (shows action rather than states it).
- Replace "Light cut the bed's silhouette; stillness answered." with a clearer physical beat that conveys Red's hesitation and the room's quiet: e.g., "The bed lay in a band of light. Everything else waited." (shorter, clearer).
- Combine the two similar permission lines to avoid stilted politeness loops. Replace the exchange:
  - "May I put it on the table?" — "Set it by the bed—do come closer," — "All right. Let me set it close so you won't have to move."
  with a single, escalating exchange that reveals the Wolf's insistence and Red's literal helpfulness:
  - Red: "May I set the basket on the table?" (soft, practical)
  - Wolf: "No—set it by the bed. Come closer, child." (coaxing, a touch sharper)
  - Red: "All right. I won't make you move." (polite, literal; clutching the basket as she steps forward)
- Add one small beat that signals Red's naivety vs. unease: a tiny gesture—she hums a nursery line, or she peeks under the quilt—so her inner confusion shows without exposition.
- Add one subtle Wolf mannerism in speech or physical presence before Red approaches (a mis-timed cough, a soft purr on the last word, or an extra-long sibilant "comeee") to foreshadow deception without stating it.
- Ensure dialogue tags are minimal: favor beats of action over "asked" and "answered" where possible (e.g., "Red tucked a lock of hair..." then the line), to keep momentum and show rather than tell.
- Keep the writer's lyrical voice but prune obvious commentary and repeated lines; aim for sharper sensory beats and dialogue that reveals character through diction and rhythm rather than narrator explanation.
