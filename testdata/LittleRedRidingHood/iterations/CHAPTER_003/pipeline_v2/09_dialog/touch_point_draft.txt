"Closer, sweetheart," the Wolf drawls, sibilant. "These old eyes don't catch the light so well."

"Grandmother, what a big nose you have."

"The better to smell you with, my dear."

"And what big ears you have."

"The better to hear you with, my dear."

"And your nailsâ€”how big they are."

"The better to grasp you with, my dear."

"Grandmother... what big teeth you have."

"The better to eat you with, my dear!"
