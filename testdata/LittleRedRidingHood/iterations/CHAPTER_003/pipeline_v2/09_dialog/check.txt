=== USER ===
You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

One thing to watch out for is that these actors have tendency to repeat themselves.  If you notice this, point out where some text is redundant and should be removed. The audience won't like hearing the same thing over and over. 

Also watch out for the wrong balance of Narration. A few sentences where needed are OK to paint the picture, but this should be dialog not long prose.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
A sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea rising from the kettle. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched, and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry—or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Grandmother’s spectacles glinted on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap had been tugged too low, an ear-tip flattened beneath its fold. The spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder scored the pillow in a careless crescent, as if a clumsy hand had knocked it. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother.

The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where a weight heavier than the bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet in a deliberate, inviting rhythm; the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother—small, oddly sweet, soft as a purr. "Come closer, dear," it coaxed. Red edged nearer, paused with the basket at her knees, glanced at the cap, and swallowed; her fingers tightened on the handle and the napkin puckered between her palms as she listened to the hush and the too-deep breaths.

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
A huntsman is tracking after wolf.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should at some point directly address the following touch-point:
Wolf: “Closer, sweetheart,” the voice purls. “These old eyes don’t catch the light so well.”
Red: “Grandmother, what a big nose you have.”
Wolf: “The better to smell you with, my dear.”
Red: “And what big ears you have.”
Wolf: “The better to hear you with, my dear.”
Red: “And—your nails—how big they are.”
Wolf: “The better to grasp you with, my dear.”
Red: “Grandmother… what big teeth you have.”
Wolf: “The better to eat you with, my dear!”


# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
"Closer, sweetheart," the Wolf drawls, sibilant. "These old eyes don't catch the light so well."

"Grandmother, what a big nose you have."

"The better to smell you with, my dear."

"And what big ears you have."

"The better to hear you with, my dear."

"And your nails—how big they are."

"The better to grasp you with, my dear."

"Grandmother... what big teeth you have."

"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Remove the adverbial stage direction inside the Wolf's quoted line. Replace
  - Current: "Closer, sweetheart," the Wolf drawls, sibilant. "These old eyes don't catch the light so well."
  - Suggested: "Closer, sweetheart," the Wolf purrs. "These old eyes don't catch the light so well."
  (keeps mood but keeps theatrics out of the speech itself)

- Make Red’s hesitation and literalness clearer and more childlike by using an em-dash for her interruptions and prefacing each question with "Grandmother" when it suits her timid politeness:
  - Replace: "Grandmother, what a big nose you have."
  - Suggested: "Grandmother—what a big nose you have."

  - Replace: "And what big ears you have."
  - Suggested: "And—what big ears you have."

  - Replace: "And your nails—how big they are."
  - Suggested: "And—your nails—how big they are."

  - Replace: "Grandmother... what big teeth you have."
  - Suggested: "Grandmother—what big teeth you have."

- Tidy Wolf’s replies so they mirror Red’s phrasing slightly (reinforces mimicry) but keep the signature "The better to..." construction:
  - Keep content but tighten rhythm; e.g.:
    - "The better to smell you with, my dear."
    - "The better to hear you with, my dear."
    - "The better to grasp you with, my dear."
    - "The better to eat you with, my dear!"

- Reduce repetitive dialogue tags. Only tag the first Wolf line and the final Wolf exclamation — let the rest stand as alternating speech to maintain theatrical cadence and avoid clutter. Example structure:
  - Wolf tag on first line: "Closer, sweetheart," the Wolf purrs. "These old eyes..."
  - Then: Red line / Wolf reply / Red line / Wolf reply… ending with the final Wolf exclamation tagged for impact.

- Keep all speech limited to Red and Wolf (no extra narrator lines inside the quoted dialog). If you need a sensory beat (breath, pause), place it as a short action line between spoken lines rather than as an adjective inside the quote.

- Minor punctuation consistency: use em-dashes for interruptions throughout (not ellipses) to preserve the storybook cadence and Red's earnest stumbles.
