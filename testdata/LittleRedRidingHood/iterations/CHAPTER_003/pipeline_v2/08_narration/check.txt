You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.


# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
A huntsman is tracking after wolf.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
A sour musk threads beneath the thyme and tea. The cap on the bedpost is tugged too low; powder dusts the pillow in a careless crescent.
The chair by the hearth is nudged askew, as if someone left it in a hurry—or made it look as though they hadn’t. Red begins to act visibly nervous.
Red edges closer, maybe to give her "Grandmother" a kiss, but she begins to hesitate. The figure pats the coverlet invitingly.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
A sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea rising from the kettle. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched, and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry—or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Grandmother’s spectacles glinted on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap had been tugged too low, an ear-tip flattened beneath its fold. The spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder scored the pillow in a careless crescent, as if a clumsy hand had knocked it. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother.

The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where a weight heavier than the bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet in a deliberate, inviting rhythm; the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother—small, oddly sweet, soft as a purr. "Come closer, dear," it coaxed. Red edged nearer, paused with the basket at her knees, glanced at the cap, and swallowed; her fingers tightened on the handle and the napkin puckered between her palms as she listened to the hush and the too-deep breaths.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Fix opening sentence grammar for immediacy: tighten to "A sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea rising from the kettle." (remove extra words that slow cadence).

- Replace the ambiguous "the nightcap had been tugged too low" with the touch-point detail: mention the cap on the bedpost tugged too low. (e.g., "the cap on the bedpost was tugged too low; an ear‑tip flattened beneath its fold.") — keep the cozy image but match the required prop.

- Clarify the spectacles image: reword "the spectacles glinted on a long shadow where the candle guttered" to something more concrete and less tangled (e.g., "Grandmother’s spectacles glinted in the guttering candlelight; their shadow fell long across the rumpled pillow").

- Make the description of the face clearer: "the spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face" is vague—specify what reads wrong while preserving unease (e.g., "the spectacles rode farther down a nose that seemed too angular, too wrong for Grandmother's soft features").

- Soften or correct "the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother": choose one adjective that evokes mismatch (e.g., "the breaths under the quilt were too deep, too slow for Grandmother") to avoid mixed metaphor.

- Resolve pronoun ambiguity and ensure allowed actors speak: change the sentence "The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet..." so the actor is explicit when the voice is produced. Either keep suspense by writing "Something under the quilt patted the coverlet..." then immediately identify: "—the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother" or simply name the Wolf at the line of speech. (Example: "Something under the quilt patted the coverlet, then the Wolf, disguising his tone, made the voice sound like Grandmother—small, oddly sweet, soft as a purr." )

- Remove the awkward "made the voice sound like Grandmother—small, oddly sweet, soft as a purr." Recast to show rather than tell: put the line of dialogue first in Grandmother's voice and tag it as Wolf speech with a sly cadence (allowed actor). Example: "'Come closer, dear,' the Wolf purred in a small, oddly sweet voice." This keeps the actor list clean and preserves theatrical menace.

- Tighten Red's reaction phrases for clarity and cadence: compress "Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way" to something more immediate (e.g., "Red leaned as if to kiss Grandmother, then froze at the quilt's wrong rustle").

- Make the basket detail sharper and consistent: change "the linen napkin puckered where a weight heavier than the bread had shifted" to specify what that suggests about the bed (e.g., "the linen napkin at the basket's lip puckered, as if something heavier than bread had shifted").

- Small rhythm edits: remove a couple of adverbs and needless qualifiers that diffuse tension ("deliberate, inviting rhythm" → pick one, e.g., "a deliberate, inviting pat" ; "paused with the basket at her knees" → "paused, basket at her knees").

- Check final sentence clarity: "glanced at the cap, and swallowed; her fingers tightened on the handle and the napkin puckered between her palms as she listened to the hush and the too-deep breaths." Break into two sentences for impact and move "the cap" reference to the bedpost cap if not already changed. (e.g., "She glanced up at the cap on the bedpost and swallowed. Her fingers tightened on the handle; the napkin puckered between her palms as the room fell to a hush and the too‑deep breaths continued.")

- Overall tone/voice: preserve the poetically odd phrasing but remove mixed metaphors and tighten imagery so each strange detail accumulates tension rather than competing for attention.
