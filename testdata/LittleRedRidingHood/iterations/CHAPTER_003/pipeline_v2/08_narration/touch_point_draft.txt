A sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea rising from the kettle. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched, and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry—or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Grandmother’s spectacles glinted on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap had been tugged too low, an ear-tip flattened beneath its fold. The spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder scored the pillow in a careless crescent, as if a clumsy hand had knocked it. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother.

The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where a weight heavier than the bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet in a deliberate, inviting rhythm; the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother—small, oddly sweet, soft as a purr. "Come closer, dear," it coaxed. Red edged nearer, paused with the basket at her knees, glanced at the cap, and swallowed; her fingers tightened on the handle and the napkin puckered between her palms as she listened to the hush and the too-deep breaths.
