You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
A sour musk threaded beneath the thyme and tea rising from the kettle. The curtain’s hem still swayed though the window was latched, and the room held its breath; the chair by the hearth was nudged askew, as if left in a hurry—or made to look so. Ash smudged the hearthstone, and the candle stub bent the light so shadows pooled where the room should have been brightest. Grandmother’s spectacles glinted on a long shadow where the candle guttered; the nightcap had been tugged too low, an ear-tip flattened beneath its fold. The spectacles rode farther down, framing a bridge that read wrong for a face. Powder scored the pillow in a careless crescent, as if a clumsy hand had knocked it. The patchwork quilt lay stretched neat, yet the bed’s silhouette sat wrong, angles sharper than an old woman's frame; the breaths under the quilt were too long and too slow for Grandmother.

The basket sat at the foot of the bed, the linen napkin puckered where a weight heavier than the bread had shifted. Red leaned forward as if to give Grandmother a kiss, then halted when the quilt rustled in that wrong way. The figure under the quilt patted the coverlet in a deliberate, inviting rhythm; the Wolf made the voice sound like Grandmother—small, oddly sweet, soft as a purr. "Come closer, dear," it coaxed. Red edged nearer, paused with the basket at her knees, glanced at the cap, and swallowed; her fingers tightened on the handle and the napkin puckered between her palms as she listened to the hush and the too-deep breaths.

---

"Closer, sweetheart," the Wolf drawls, sibilant. "These old eyes don't catch the light so well."

"Grandmother, what a big nose you have."

"The better to smell you with, my dear."

"And what big ears you have."

"The better to hear you with, my dear."

"And your nails—how big they are."

"The better to grasp you with, my dear."

"Grandmother... what big teeth you have."

"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
A huntsman is tracking after wolf.

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
Red, Wolf

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
The final phrase "the better to eat you with!" is the classic jump scare!
The quilt bunches as muscles bunch beneath it. A hand—no, a paw?—hooks the quilt’s edge.
The clock stutters one tick late; the teapot lid chatters once. 
Red screams, and is sent to join her Grandmother in the belly of the beast.


# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

Red heard the clock on the mantle stutter one tick late. The teapot lid chattered once. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it. A paw hooked the edge. Wolf's breath fogged the spectacles; he wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh, powdered whiskers pluming into the gloom. Red jolted back, her heel skidding as the basket tilted against the floorboard. She screamed; the quilt yawned like a mouth—then closed over her.

Wolf smoothed his sleeve with a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead. Warm dark folded around Red—Grandmother's shawl pressed against her cheek—and a low, sibilant purl threaded the stitches. A single tick answered.

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.

Now produce a concise, actionable list of suggested changes and fixes only. Do not restate the findings verbatim; output just the suggestions.

=== RESPONSE ===
- Replace ambiguous pronoun "he" with "the Wolf" in "he wiped them clear" to eliminate any reference confusion.

- Restore the initial hesitation image: change "A paw hooked the edge." to "A hand—no, a paw?—hooked the edge." to keep the uncanny uncertainty.

- Make the swallowing/action of being taken into the Wolf's belly explicit and visceral to satisfy the touch-point: after "the quilt yawned like a mouth—then closed over her." add one short sentence such as "The coverlet folded; a hot, moist darkness swallowed Red, and she felt herself sliding, rolling, then stopping against something that was not a bed." or "The quilt closed over her and, with a wet, living hush, drew her into the Wolf's throat." (Keep the writer's voice—choose the version that feels right.)

- Clarify whose shawl is felt: change "Grandmother's shawl pressed against her cheek" to "the Wolf's borrowed shawl pressed against Red's cheek" or "the shawl—Grandmother's, or a likeness of it—pressed against Red's cheek" to avoid implying Grandmother is present.

- Make the clock/teapot timings more tightly linked to the final beat: change "A single tick answered." to "The clock stuttered one tick late; the teapot lid chattered once in answer." or keep the teapot earlier and end with "One single, late tick answered." Ensure the stutter and the teapot chatter both occur near the climax.

- Soften or simplify "a low, sibilant purl threaded the stitches" if it risks obscurity—suggest alternatives like "a low, sibilant purr threaded the stitches" or "a sibilant purr rode the fabric" depending on desired diction.

- Consider adding one very brief line with Red's scream tied to the swallowing action (if not covered by the new swallowing sentence): e.g., "Red screamed as the dark closed over her." to satisfy the explicit "Red screams" requirement.

- Ensure no hint or mention of the huntsman; keep all imagery focused on Red and the Wolf only (no other sounds or distant footsteps).
