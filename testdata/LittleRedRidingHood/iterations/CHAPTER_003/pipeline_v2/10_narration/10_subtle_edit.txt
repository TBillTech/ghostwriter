You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

Also, you may need to improve typesetting and odd punctuation. If you see a line that is "escaped", with single quotes in double quotes, un-escape it. This needs to be prose or dialog with prose.  There should not be titles, markdown, play style character indicators or any formatting that would be unusual for a fiction book.  Do allow tables or charts when they make sense.

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
Red had promised to bring goodies and walked the pine-smelling path with her hood catching the light and the basket creaking like a vow, unaware the sleek, flattering wolf had slipped away onto a deer-track, reached the cottage first, and with practiced calm had swallowed her grandmother whole before arranging the room into a careful masquerade; he pried open the latch, powdered his muzzle, tugged on cap and spectacles, soothed the quilt and set the teapot whispering so the cottage would answer Red with the warmth of kin. She stepped inside to net curtains that sifted the afternoon into green pools and called softly, basket in hand, while a coaxing, grandmotherly coo bade her nearer; the house leaned in, thyme and tea rose, but a sour, wrong musk threaded the bed's shadow, the candle bent light into pooling dark, spectacles glinted on an oddly shaped silhouette and the nightcap drooped over a curious ear-tip. Red, humming the nursery tune, hesitated as the bed's angles read wrong and the cover shifted with a weight not belonging to age; urged by that sweet, purling voice she leaned to kiss the bed and listened as beneath the quilt a breath that was too deep answered her. Questions fell into the hush—about eyes, ears, nose, nails—and each answer, honeyed and false, tightened the room's intent until the climax: a splintering creak, whiskers powdered like flour in the gloom, the quilt yawned, and the mockery of a grandmother's teeth closed on Red. The basket tumbled, the scream was swallowed by a ticking clock, and when the house smoothed back into its domestic hush the wolf sat content, a new fullness beneath the patchwork, Grandmother folded within his belly, and the cottage waited with the steady, indifferent tick of time.

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
Red's point of view
I had meant only to be helpful—basket creaking like a promise, my hood catching the light as I stepped into the cottage that seemed to lean toward me—but the room answered with a wrongness that tugged at the edges of my certainty. Net curtains sliced the afternoon into green pools and thyme and tea rose from the kettle, and I called for Grandmother, thinking to place the bread and jam and give her a quick kiss; her voice came back soft and coaxing, and I let my feet carry me closer. Everything hesitated odd and small: a draught that tugged the curtain though the window was latched, a chair askew as if left in a hurry, spectacles glaring on a shadow that read wrong, a nightcap drooping over a pricked shape. There was a sour, foreign musk by the bed, the quilt's silhouette sat too sharp, and when I leaned in to kiss the pillow the breath beneath it answered too deep. The voice bade me nearer and each question I asked—about the eyes, the ears, the nose—was answered with a honeyed lie that drew the room tight around me until the quilt bunched, whiskers powdered in the dark, and the bed yawned open; my scream was swallowed by the ticking clock and the basket tumbled as the patchwork smoothed itself over a new fullness, and the cottage hummed back into its ordinary hush with me gone.

Wolf's point of view
Hunger and patient craft had kept me light on the shingles and warm in the thyme as I slipped in before her; I checked the latch, pooled my voice into a kinder thing, and watched the cottage breathe out mint and ash as if expecting a visitor. When Red stepped inside, bright and trusting, the stage was set: net curtains dimpled light, the kettle hissed to keep up appearances, the chair was nudged askew and a sour note placed near the bed to pass for age’s forgetting. I let my voice soften into a grandmother’s purl, steered her with coaxing phrases so she would set the basket by the bed and lean in; each question she offered I answered in a sweeter falsehood, sewing the room tighter until the moment I needed. The clock stuttered, the candle bowed, and the quilt gathered as muscles readied under the stitches; whiskers powdered the gloom and a paw hooked the edge. When the patchwork opened like a mouth the work finished itself in a single surge—then I smoothed my sleeve, breathed out contentment, and the cottage folded back into its domestic pose with a new warmth at the hip and the steady tick of time marking the waiting.

Forest Path's point of view
I had watched her small feet press my pale dust and held the sunbeams as she hummed beneath my pines, and I felt the wolf uncoil and slip through my thyme toward the cottage, timing his knock to the tilt of the light. The lane answered in the soft click of a latch and the sigh of a kettle; I watched the house lean in as Red stepped across the threshold, her bright hood brisk against the shaded room. Inside, net curtains turned the afternoon green and the air filled with thyme and tea while an odd musk lingered by the bed—an arrhythmic mark against the homely smells I keep. The wolf had nudged a chair, powdered a pillow, let the nightcap droop and the spectacles glint wrong, and I saw the way his coaxing voice pulled her closer until the quilt breathed too deep. The clock faltered, the candle bowed, the patchwork shivered, and then the bed opened its mouth; the lane held its breath as Red's cry was swallowed and the cottage smoothed over a new fullness, the tick of the mantle resumed, and I kept the thin bar of light that caught the dust where footsteps had passed.

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
The final phrase "the better to eat you with!" is the classic jump scare!
The quilt bunches as muscles bunch beneath it. A hand—no, a paw?—hooks the quilt’s edge.
The clock stutters one tick late; the teapot lid chatters once. 
Red screams, and is sent to join her Grandmother in the belly of the beast.


# Rules for generation:
1. **Edit ONLY**: Try to copy the draft copy as much as possible.  ONLY make changes if the specific suggestions call for it. Keep changes strategic and necessary, and try to conserve the prior copy. 

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

The clock on the mantle ticked, then stuttered one tick late; the teapot lid chattered once on a thin puff of steam. The candle’s flame bowed and the bedframe gave a short, splintering creak. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it; a paw hooked the edge. Powdered whiskers plumed in a dusty puff against the paneled gloom. The patchwork flowers rippled like water as something moved under the stitches. Wolf surged from the quilts; the patchwork gave a sharper, hollow tug. His breath fogged the spectacles, then wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh. Red jolted back; her heel skidded and the basket tilted against the floorboard. Her scream cut the room; the clock swallowed the next tick. The quilt yawned like a mouth; then it swallowed her.

Wolf smoothed his sleeve and exhaled, a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead of fire. The patchwork quilt lay smooth again, fuller at the hip; a new roundness shifted beneath the stitches. Inside Wolf’s belly, Red found Grandmother folded there, and the house fell quiet and waited. The clock resumed its ticking.

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
- Replace vague subjects with names in key beats: change any opening sentences that begin with "The clock..." or "The candle..." to lead with "Red" or "Wolf" when their perceptions/actions matter (e.g., "Red heard the clock stutter..." / "Wolf's breath fogged the spectacles...") to remove ambiguity and keep focalization tight.

- Tighten the jump-scare cadence: shorten the few sentences before the final swallow so the rhythm accelerates—make the clock stutter, teapot chatter, quilt bunch, paw hook, Red's scream, then the swallow—each as sharp, single images. Remove or condense intermediary lines that slow momentum (e.g., "The candle’s flame bowed and the bedframe gave a short, splintering creak").

- Clarify agency on the spectacles: make it explicit that Wolf fogged then wiped them ("Wolf's breath fogged the spectacles; he wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh") so the actions read as the Wolf's theatrical mannerism rather than anonymous happenings.

- Rework the awkward "the patchwork gave a sharper, hollow tug": replace with a clearer, stronger image tied to the Wolf or the quilt ("the patchwork tugged sharp and hollow as Wolf surged") to avoid passive or confusing phrasing.

- Preserve the child’s point-of-view immediacy in the swallowing line: keep Red-centered verbs (e.g., "Red screamed; the quilt yawned like a mouth — then closed over her") rather than letting the narrator drop too far away before the swallow.

- Remove or rephrase the overly serene aftermath lines that undercut horror and agency: cut or stiffen "Wolf smoothed his sleeve and exhaled, a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied..." to something more in keeping with the Wolf's theatrical menace (e.g., "Wolf smoothed his sleeve with a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead.") — avoid peaceful phrasing like "fell quiet and waited."

- Make the "inside the belly" beat more visceral but not explicit about other actors: change "Inside Wolf’s belly, Red found Grandmother folded there" to a tighter sensory image from Red's (or an omniscient) angle that implies being joined without overexplaining (e.g., "Warm dark folded around her—Grandmother's shawl pressed against Red's cheek"), so it satisfies the touch-point without drifting into flat exposition.

- Delete or trim the line "The clock resumed its ticking." If you keep it, place it as a closing punctuation that echoes the jump-scare (one short sentence) and avoid giving the scene a lull; otherwise the image feels tonal-softening.

- Watch mixed metaphors and tonal shifts: remove lines that flip between whimsical simile and clinical statement in the same sentence (e.g., "The patchwork flowers rippled like water as something moved under the stitches") — pick a single, strong image and lean into it.

- Preserve voice quirks: keep at least one Wolf mannerism (elongated sibilant or "purls") in the immediate pre- or post-swallower line to maintain theatrical menace, and retain Red's physical reactions (clutching basket, heel skidded) but compress them into fewer, sharper beats.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions, or to fix typesetting.

=== RESPONSE ===
"The better to eat you with, my dear!"

Red heard the clock on the mantle stutter one tick late. The teapot lid chattered once. The quilt bunched as muscles gathered beneath it. A paw hooked the edge. Wolf's breath fogged the spectacles; he wiped them clear with a slow, contented sigh, powdered whiskers pluming into the gloom. Red jolted back, her heel skidding as the basket tilted against the floorboard. She screamed; the quilt yawned like a mouth—then closed over her.

Wolf smoothed his sleeve with a small, satisfied sound; the candle steadied to a thin bead. Warm dark folded around Red—Grandmother's shawl pressed against her cheek—and a low, sibilant purl threaded the stitches. A single tick answered.
