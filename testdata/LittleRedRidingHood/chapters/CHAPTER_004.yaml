      name: "Approach to the Silent Cottage"
      description: |
        Evening lays a green hush over the pines as a huntsman follows a ribbon of prints that lope from streambank to door. A child's cry—brief, strangled, then swallowed by the trees—has already sent him off the trail and toward the cottage with his Bow low and his breath held.
        The door stands ajar. Inside, no chatter of kettle, no clatter of cups—only the measured ticking of a clock and a smell that is not illness, not age, but wild.

  - actors: ["Huntsman"]

  - narration: |
      He circles once, listens again, and slips inside. The quiet feels manufactured, the air thick with fur-musk and flour dust. His eye takes in the neat room, the undisturbed table, the bed with its extra-round quilt. He readies his bow, alerted to the strangeness.

  - scene:
      name: "Inside: The Belly and the Blade"
      description: |
        The bed inhales and exhales in heavy bellows. Beneath the nightcap and spectacles, the sleeper’s muzzle peeks powder-white, and the quilt mounds like a harvest sack. The huntsman recognizes the trespass not only in scent and shape but in the cruel satisfaction resting on those whiskered lips.
        He does not shout. He Carefully aims the bow.

      I have found you wolf, says the huntsman. Your terrible deeds end here. 
      The wolf protests once that he is an old Grandma, how dare he accuse of such.  The Huntsman points out all the clues, the and to double underline it, wolf muzzles are recognizably not the profile of an old woman.
      The huntsman declares, "If you were human, I couldn't do this, but for the beasts of the forest, I am judge, jury, and executioner."

  - narration: |
      The Huntsman fires the arrow, and it flys true. Wolf slumps dead in the bed, with an arrow in the eye. 
      The huntsman notices the moving belly of Wolf, and partly in shock, party in fascination, cuts wolf's belly open with his skinning knife.
