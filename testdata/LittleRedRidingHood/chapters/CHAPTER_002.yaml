  - scene:
      name: "At the Cottage Gate"
      description: |
        Having slipped from the deer track ahead of Red, the Wolf reaches a small cottage tucked in thyme and smoke.
        The garden is a patchwork of herbs and cabbages, the door sun-bleached and simple; inside, a kettle hums and an old clock ticks.
        The world here smells of mint and ash and rest, vulnerable in its quiet routine.
      props:
        - name: "Cottage Door-Latch"
          significance: "Threshold of trust; a simple defense turned invitation"
          description: |
            A thumb-worn iron latch, warm from afternoon light.
            It answers to a familiar knock and an even more familiar voice.
        - name: "Hearth and Kettle"
          significance: "Homeliness to be imitated; cover for small sounds"
          description: |
            A blackened iron kettle keeps time in soft breaths over banked coals,
            its steam sewing the room together with the smell of nettle tea.
        - name: "Teacup on Saucer"
          significance: "Grandmother’s pause interrupted"
          description: |
            Porcelain with a hairline crack, rim blushed by tea.
            It waits beside a chair draped with a shawl.
        - name: "Walking Stick"
          significance: "Measure of frailty the Wolf will exploit"
          description: |
            A hazel stick, polished by years of palms, leaning by the door.

  - actors:
      - "Wolf"
      - "Grandmother"

  - narration: |
      The Wolf stands in the garden’s stillness and listens: no Red yet, only bees and the slow metronome of the clock.
      He smooths his voice in his throat like a blade in a sheath, then pads to the door.

  - dialog: |
      Wolf (mimicking Red, soft and breathy): "Grandmother, it’s me. Mama sent bread and jam. May I come in?"
      Grandmother (from within, muffled with age): "Lift the latch, child. I’ve been waiting."

  - mixed: |
      The latch lifts with an unthreatening click; the kettle sighs.
      The cottage, accustomed to gentle footfalls, does not yet recognize the weight of a predator.

  - scene:
      name: "Inside, the Disguise"
      description: |
        The aftermath of swallowing Grandma: The chair is knocked over, and the teapot is still warm. But Wolf organizes the room halfway through the scene.
      props:
        - name: "Grandmother’s Nightcap and Spectacles"
          significance: "Tools of disguise; innocence repurposed"
          description: |
            A soft cap with a blue ribbon, and spectacles smudged with use.
            They pinch the Wolf’s ears and blur his eyes, but lend him a silhouette.
        - name: "Feather Quilt and Bed Curtains"
          significance: "Stage for the masquerade"
          description: |
            A puffed quilt stitched with strawberries, curtains that turn a bed into a small theater.
            They muffle size and shape, smooth the outline of teeth.
        - name: "Shutter Hook"
          significance: "Conspiracy with the dark"
          description: |
            A simple hook-and-eye that tames daylight.
            Once fastened, the room is quiter and dimmer.
        - name: "Powder Tin"
          significance: "A trick to soften a snout"
          description: |
            A little tin of rice powder; a dab on the muzzle keeps the fur from gleaming.

  - actors:
      - "Wolf"

  - narration: |
      Wolf enters, then swallows Grandma up in one bite. His belly is distended, but Wolf doesn't mind.
      
  - narration: | 
      He tidies the impression of struggle to nothing, sets the kettle to murmur, and folds the shawl around his shoulders.
      In the mirror’s dim, his mouth learns a smaller smile. He tries on a cough the way one tries on a glove.

  - foreshadowing: |
      A faint thread of humming drifts through the garden—the tune Red kept on the path—then fades as the wind shifts.
      The Wolf’s ears lift under the nightcap. He smiles with care, and waits.

  - mixed: |
      Wolf (testing): "Come in, dear heart. Mind the step."
      Wolf (again, higher, kinder): "Oh, what a day you must have had."
      The words fit. He settles deeper into the quilt.

  - narration: |
      Dust shivers in a bar of light that escaped the shutters; the clock’s tick grows loud enough to measure nerves.
      From far off, a rhythm of axe on wood answers the kettle’s breath, iron and sap interlacing on the air.
