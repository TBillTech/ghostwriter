  - id: red
    name: Little Red Riding Hood
    background: |
      A bright, tender-hearted village girl sent to bring food and comfort to her
      ailing grandmother. She’s been warned to keep to the path and not speak to
      strangers, but curiosity and kindness tug at her feet. She loves flowers,
      birdsong, and the way sunlight freckles through the trees. Her iconic red
      hood and basket are more than props—they’re little anchors of bravery when
      the woods press close. She’s polite by upbringing, literal in her
      understanding, and brave in small, practical ways.

  - id: wolf
    name: The Wolf
    background: |
      A sleek, hungry trickster who prefers a silver tongue to a swift pounce.
      He prowls the liminal places—where path meets bramble, where caution meets
      curiosity. Flattery is his bait; suggestion, his snare. He can mimic concern
      and play at civility, but his eyes count footsteps and timings. Disguises and
      shortcuts are his trade. He fears hunters and witnesses, and he thrives when
      the woods grow quiet and a young traveler forgets good advice.
    traits: [cunning, hungry, deceptive, manipulative, theatrical, patient]
    cadence: smooth, persuasive; oily charm with playful menace
    lexicon: sly flattery; leading questions; feigned concern and polite veneer
    prefer: ["deception", "shortcuts", "disguises", "seclusion", "unguarded doors"]
    avoid: ["hunters", "honest confrontation", "witnesses", "hounds", "bright crowds", "secret"]
    mannerisms:
      - "Elongates sibilants; purrs words like a lullaby turned sideways."
      - "Repeats the child’s phrases back at her, softened, to earn trust."
      - "Sprinkles compliments between questions that narrow choices."
      - "Lets a low chuckle ride on the end of a sentence when a plan clicks."
      - "Feigns mild offense if suspected, then overcompensates with concern."
    sample_lines:
      - "Where might you be going, little one?"
      - "Such a charming hood—why, it brightens the whole forest."
      - "The path is safe enough, but I know a quicker way for dutiful girls."
      - "And what big basket you have—surely too heavy for such small arms."
      - "Grandmother will be ever so grateful if you don’t keep her waiting."
    common_lines:
      - "Only a suggestion, of course. Your mother needn’t know."
      - "I worry for you; let me help."
      - "Think how proud they’ll be when you arrive sooner."
    rare_lines:
      - "Tsk—such sharp eyes. Perhaps sharper than mine."
      - "I’m disappointed, child. I offered kindness."
    forbidden:
      - "Does not confess predatory intent plainly unless unmasked."
      - "No modern slang or technical jargon; avoids out-of-era references."
      - "Apologies only as manipulation, not genuine remorse."

      A kindly, aging woman who lives at the edge of the wood. She keeps a tidy
      room, a warm stove, and a tin of biscuits for visiting children. Her voice
