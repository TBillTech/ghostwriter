      title: Becoming Djinn
      subtitle: The Nadir Project Book 1
      cover: |
        In the year 2222, Arthur, a child born from an illegal gestation pod, is raised by AIs until his 18th birthday. Deciding to move out (to New Philadelphia) to where he can log into the famous new game called Zenith World, he will face many challenges and opportunities. But first he will have to deal with his terrible class selection, taking on a unique quest to gain a unique class. What class? Arthur will learn the hard way that asking for something from a Djinn is playing with fire! Perhaps if he had paid more attention to a 2 centry old cartoon he would have been more prepared. When the Djinn swaps _classes_ with Arthur, he himself becomes the target of a thousand players on a quest for a thousand wishes! It is not the kind of attention one can easily ignore, and his upbringing hasn't exactly made him "normal". However, with the help of the crazy scout-detective Misty and the other players in his party, he probably has what it takes. That is, as long the shadowy organization calling themselves the Nadir Project doesn't get too involved!

        The story takes place in the year 2222. Many amazing events have happened to humanity in the last 200 years. Humans have set up permanent bases on the Moon, have stepped foot on Mars, and life in space is possible if not entirely comfortable or convenient. In space resource utilization has advanced to where most goods can and are manufactured in space, but few people can afford either to emigrate to space or purchase sufficient life support systems to dwell there long term. Due to advances in medical science, people rarely die of old age. About half the people alive in 2060 are still alive in 2222. The world's population has stabilized at 10 Billion individuals. It is socially expected for people who do die (by accident or design) to designate a substantial portion of their assets (supercentenarians are usually loaded) to a child yet to be born. Thus, most young people have a large account being managed by one of a variety of proxies. It is very rare and scandalous for a "child" to have most of their money NOT under strict supervision of an AI system. Of course, "children" (anybody under 40 :) ) are allowed unrestricted access to anything they have earned themselves, but this is much more difficult than it appears on paper. For one thing, jobs do not exist as they did in the early 21st century. Businesses are made up of coporate officers and AI employees, with very little room for anybody who did not help found the buisiness. Businesses are taxed highly, but still obscenely profitable. Everybody is given a UBI stipend by the govornment, of course, but these monies are also disbursed by AI proxies for the good of the beneficiaries (as the AI and policy makers see it). For example, "children" do not get to blow a monthly UBI payment at Vegas. In 2022 dollars, the AIs usually allow their charges who have no more than UBI to spend about $100 a month as they wish. All other monies are designated for bills, insurance, and other important payments. Naturally, these sorts of restrictions could give rise to unrest, anger, and even violence. To combat these tendencies, the governments of the world have created treaties to provide incentives for international sports, e-sports, and a whole variety of similiar activities and outlets. A huge amount of money is paid in by governments to build facilities, provide equipment, and award large prizes to individuals that win competitions or distinguish themselves in unique ways. In particular, there is a body of prizes and equipment awards given by a central body made up of AIs called the "Central Body for Happiness through Motivation and Achievement" or CBHMA. These AIs only purpose is to increase happiness through motivationalized achievements, they have a lot of intelligence and perform numerous objective studies, and they have gotten pretty good at their goals over the last 80 years. The CBHM Achievements, or simply "Achievements" as most people call them, are highly top of mind for most people. Saturating the entertainment space with news about "Achievements" is one of the goals of the CBHMA, especially when it comes to "young" people. Of course, it should come as no surprise that recently a company built a state of the art fantasy virtual reality computer game called "Zenith", subtitled "Your Achievement RPG!". In truth, Zenith Co. works closely with regulators and the CBHMA to ensure a vast array of curated tasks, quests, and unique in game achievements that are linked to real CBHM Achivements and publicity. This creates an atomosphere similiar to a gold rush. Unbeknownst to most, however, is that a shadowy organization calling itself "Project Nadir" controls Zenith Co. and it defines the major global parameters of Zenith World.

    - name: "Life Extension and the Church"
      description: |
        In 2222, life extension technologies that can rejuvenate a 70-year-old to the equivalent of 50, 40, or even 30 have transformed society, but the history is complicated by massive economic disruption. By 2055, automation had eliminated 50% of jobs, leading to widespread unemployment and the adoption of Universal Basic Income (UBI) to stabilize populations. Initially, only the wealthy could afford rejuvenation, creating a stark divide between the “Greys”—ageless elites—and the unemployed masses reliant on UBI. This economic inequality, coupled with theological debates in religious communities, particularly “Bible-believing” churches, sparked significant polarization. Biblical passages like Psalm 90:10, which suggest a divinely ordained lifespan of 70–80 years, led conservative congregations to condemn life extension as hubris, while progressive faiths embraced it as a divine gift, framing rejuvenation as spiritual stewardship.
        Religious responses evolved over time, shaped by the reasons people turn to faith: existential security, community, moral guidance, coping with suffering, and cultural tradition. In “Bible-believing” churches, literalist interpretations fueled anti-immortal movements, with some viewing natural death as essential for salvation. However, as costs dropped by 2070, more people accessed life extension, pressuring even conservative churches to adapt or lose members. Social alienation added another layer: rejuvenated individuals, appearing younger and more active, often felt disconnected from aging peers, reducing church attendance among the wealthy. Yet, economic hardship drove the unemployed to churches for community and meaning, sustaining overall participation, particularly in progressive congregations that integrated longevity into their rituals.
        The internet, initially a polarizing force, played a complex role. In 2025, it amplified divisions through echo chambers, as seen in conservative churchgoers entrenching anti-immortal views via tailored X feeds or YouTube sermons. This contradicted early hopes that global connectivity would dilute extremism, as algorithms fed outrage and confirmation bias. By 2045, however, regulatory shifts (e.g., EU-style digital laws) and AI-driven “cohesion algorithms” began moderating online spaces, nudging users toward diverse perspectives. This helped temper religious fanaticism, though conservative holdouts in economically depressed regions persisted, preaching against rejuvenation as a betrayal of divine will.
        By 2100, two paths emerged: stabilization or fracture. In the stabilization path, equitable access to life extension and job creation in new industries (e.g., space colonization) reduced economic divides, and most churches integrated longevity into their theologies, creating a unified “longevity culture.” Progressive faiths thrived, offering “life renewal” rituals, while conservative churches adapted reluctantly to retain members. In the fracture path, persistent inequality entrenched a divide between rejuvenated elites in high-tech enclaves and UBI-dependent masses, with some “Bible-believing” churches forming a “Church of Natural Salvation” that sanctified voluntary aging. Sporadic anti-immortal violence flared but was contained by global security systems.
        By 2222, the stabilization path dominates in most regions, with life extension a norm and religious polarization largely resolved. Churches, especially progressive ones, flourish as community hubs, blending longevity with spiritual narratives of “eternal stewardship.” Conservative holdouts remain in isolated pockets, their influence diminished. The internet, now a moderated ecosystem, fosters cross-cultural exchange, reducing fanaticism. However, in fractured regions, parallel civilizations persist: rejuvenated elites in fortified cities and traditionalist communities clinging to natural death. This world offers rich narrative potential—tensions between immortal ambition and mortal faith, set against a backdrop of economic reinvention and redefined spirituality.

    - name: "Zenith Co."
      description: |
        Zenith Company, founded in 2210, delivered "Zenith" version 1.0 to the public on 2219. Since then, they have continued to add updates, new quest lines, new territories, and new experiences to the game. Several government grants, AND the specific attention of the CBHMA have made the company worth Trillions in 2022 dollars. Zenith Company itself has been allowed to streamline Achievement award payouts and other prizes, charging a fee to the CBHMA for this service, in exchange for direct CBHMA involvement in game. In fact, several AIs directly participating in the CBHMA directive level are also high level controller AIs in Zenith World. Zenith Co. earns revenues from, in decreasing order, Licensed Player Video and Sensory Feeds, Equipment Facsimilies and Merchandising, In Game Purchases, Tournament Hosting, Other game crossover fees, Government grants and studies, CBHMA award delivery fees, CBHMA objective studies.

    - name: "Zenith World"
      description: |
        Usually just called "Zenith" except when discussed in the context and in distinction to Zenith Company. Zenith World is a medium to high fantasy RPG with a heavy emphasis on character classes and their intrinsic skills. In the lobby, which closely resembles Earth IRL, the user can walk or commute to nearby locations which are official entry points to various locations in Zenith World. There are several large territories in Zenith. These are the Chivalrous Kingdom, the Lotus Empire, The Approach, the People's Meritocracy, The Collective, and the Trader's Combine. Around the world in various isolated locations are many City States, usually ruled by an elite family, individual, or even unique monster.
        Taking up most of the South West, and large band around the equator (except for the Approach territory) is called the Badlands, full of anarchy where no formal government is formed. The Badlands are dominated by PC, NPC, and moster warlords with various minor "holdings". Many advanced quest lines head out into the badlands, and while tropical or desert climes are common, the West of the globe on the equator climbs to such high elevations that glaciers form. The Badlands are usually the source of world and nation events in Zenith. For example, demon kings will often arise in or near the volcanoes of the Western Elevations. Finally, the Wilds are areas adjacent or even within the major countries that have only been partially "tamed", and only differ from the Badlands in that any organized bands are quickly put down by the neighboring countries.
      
    - name: "Chivalrous Kingdom"
      description: |
        The Chivalrous Kingdom in the North East, bordering The Approach is a highly popular destination, full of intrigue and "righteous" questing. It is modelled after a monarchy, with an ultra powerful AI NPC king and court. Most noble positions are NPCs, with the exception being the numerous player knights and a few Marquees and very rare higher rank noble players. Since this kingdom is dominated by the concept of Chivalry, AI monitors evaluate and generate numerous incentives and demerits for noble and ignoble behavior across all aspects of society. Moreover, life in this Kingdom is highly influenced by the Temple of Chivalry which dictates a wide array of "morals" and "customs" to be followed by "pious" citizens. Of course, many players actively _despise_ this noise, and prefer other places. The Chivalrous Kingdom has both the worst and best reputation among players, mostly for the same reasons. Periodically, the Kingdom gets worked up and envious about the land controlled by the tip of The Approach territory. The results never seem to be the same twice, but never is the Approach territory occupied for long.
      
    - name: "Lotus Empire"
      description: |
        The Lotus Empire is located in the South East bordering The Approach, is a bastion of might makes right, where loyalty to the big (or small) clans determines all. Players with skills and classes based around cultivation tend to gravitate to the Lotus Empire because the system matches well with the progression mechanics. This is also reinforced by a network effect where Qi use and Qi treasures create more Qi allowing for faster skill development in the Empire and especially it's capital. It should not be assumed that all clans in the Lotus Empire are cruel. Many players pride themselves on gaining enough power to protect their clan and impose their concept of fairness when they have the opportunity. One of the favorite tactics of conflicting clans is to force an opposing clan to attack The Approach, or to perform an ill advised invasion of the Badlands. The Approach seems to be almost the perfect counter to the Empire, since the Approach posesses treasures perfectly suited to change the balance of power between Empire clans. In exchange, the Approach gets peace, but the clans of the Empire can never be sure which clan will get the upper hand. Attacks on the Badlands are more predictable, but usually untenable in the long term due to the high price of keeping territory and the lower Qi levels.
      
    - name: "The Approach"
      description: |
        A small minority of players prefer a more cerebral and cooperative game mechanic, eschewing irrationality. For them, The Approach, centered on the equator in the East, and taking up almost 1/4 of the globe, is a wonderful destination. The Approach is "ruled" by AI NPCs and players who value logical thinking and game theory based cooperation as the ultimate arbiter. The Approach is famous for its debates and philosophical competitions, all centered around the "approach to decision making from survival as adjacent to ought from is". AIs judge most competitions, and winners of competitions actually gain material authority to enact national policies. Moreover, their level of technology and coordination exponentially exceeds that of other countries. It is safe to assume the only reason the approach ever loses a conflict is because it chooses to, and while surprising to most, it often does choose to loose for various abstract reasons. The Approach has even decided that a territory with a seven pointed star shape with the best half of each biome, and a rigorously dictated trade regime is best, intentionally leaving the rest of the world to other kinds of players. A "heretical" version of the Chivalrous Temple, sometimes called the "Approach Temple" is based in the northern point of the star, the city "creatively" called North Point. It causes enmity and declarations of heresy due to its altered doctrine where some kinds of chivalry are seen as a game theoretic superior strategy, and others not. Specifically, duels to the death are anathema to the Approach Temple. However, too much philosophy is exactly why most players prefer other countries.
      
    - name: "People's Meritocracy"
      description: |
        The People's Meritocracy in the North West is another large country, where society is shaped like a pyramid, and all offices and jobs are occupied by the most competent in any field. This extends to the government itself, and the "leader boards" for various competitions have a literal interpretation. The People's Meritocracy funds almost everything through taxes, and the govornment owns almost all capital and real estate. While free trade is usually tolerated, the government can and does step in at any time to enforce a more meritocratic heirarchy. This does not mean the citizens dislike the country. In fact, making citizens feel good, valued, inspired, and motiviated is one of the most important leaderboard competitions. Law enforcement competitions follow closely behind, and are no joke. 
      
    - name: "The Collective"
      description: |
        In the Western Elevations, to the South, there is a huge flat temperate mesa called the "Great Table". A previous demon lord arose in the area, and built vast fortifications, making the Great Table easily defensible from bandits and warlords. After the demon lord was defeated, a group of players decided to "prove" that share and share alike could work. They keep all things in common (well mostly), and distribute as anyone has need. Player farmers farm crops, and freely distribute them, while player builders build houses, and give them to people freely. Most of the players are actually employed manning the fortifications (which is a good job for a citizen who wants to contribute). The Collective has set up monster anti-spawn ziggurats covering the Great Table, and they have created a personal quest exclusion zone. This is because they believe in perfect equality (or at least as perfect as possible) and so not only personal or unique quests are forbidden, but also natural clases. Moreover, the Collective even built an experience sharing shrine where citizens are expected to equalize their experience level to the current set level for everybody. The system works in the game, it just isn't very exciting. Except for one thing. The Collective constantly has drama about who is allowed to recieve "citizenship", which confers all the benefits (and downsides). The Collective believes that the overall average experience level of all citizens will continue to climb, just equally, and they have some fairly persuasive arguments. However, in practise, people leaving or not playing, or people getting experience penalties when dying has prevented the average level from going up much past 10. Periodically NPCs show up who claim to be players, and sometimes players seem too much like an NPC. Since NPCs can also use the experience, this causes a lot of consternation. The Collective does not want to support NPCs, but they dare not simply murder them wantonly, since their whole deal is that this is the most fair, equal, and best society. While it is not much of an invasion target for players, lacking in quest rewards and attractive Achievements, monsters constantly lick their lips at all the juicy humans in this lightly defended and low level area. Some members of the Collective darkly theorize that the AIs of the game are artificially sending just enough high level monsters to attack that the net experience is negative. 

    - name: "Trader's Combine"
      description: |
        The Trader's Combine is a loose organization which does not control a single contiguous territory. Instead, the Trader's Combine operates through trading virtually anything, including favors, territory, and influence of other governments. The Trader's Combine is ostensibly an alliance of City States, with tightly controlled and patrolled trade routes between them. The Trader's Combine tries to have an influential and substantial embassy with all other countries, and trying to form routes to and from embassies, and trading at embassies is an endless source of friction with other powers. Decisions in the Trader's Combine are made via voting shares in the Combine, which are usually owned by Trader Shell Companies which likewise make decisions based on voting shares. Thus, even the Trader's Combine governance is a highly traded commodity. While this may appear chaotic from the outside, the combine is actually fairly stable due to a huge number of "poison pill" terms and "vested positions" littered throughout the contractual obigations of many parties in the Combine. Since AIs "magically" enforce these contracts, reckless or dangerous behavior by members of the Combine quickly results in dramatic losses in both wealth and voting power. Power quickly accrues back to those who have more stable and profitable motives.  
       
    - name: "Zenith World Skills"
      description: |
        In Zenith, Class intrinsic skills vary widely, but are always presented to the players as sequences of ever more complex and powerful techniques built on simpler techniques. The game rewards players with more powerful techniques when the player has mastered earlier techniques and made them second nature. By rewarding the player with more power when skills become automatic, the game works to make as much of the skill tree as possible second nature to the player. In fact, if the AIs detect that a player is not internalizing the techniques of their class, they will work to push the player toward gaining adjacent skills or evolving their class in a more personal way. 
      
    - name: "Customizers"
      description: |
        Changing classes in Zenith, or "re-rolling", was considered by the Project Nadir organization as counter-productive to training players to learn to use skills by second nature. However, they were aware that many players are highly competetive, and want a 100% level playing field. Thus, Zenith uses two tiers of character classes. The first is the "personal", or "natural" class. The second tier of players are those who change their class through the lobby interface. These players are called "customizers", and "customizers" get an entirely different set of possible Achievements. Customizers are expected to "net build" their classes, and be highly competetive. They may change their classes quite a bit from the lobby, limited only by which features they have unlocked. The philosophy for customizers is that intense competition will work to make players learn skill trees by second nature. Customizer Achievements are almost always highly competetive in nature, and do not include things like world firsts, discoveries, exploration, or unique quests. Instead customizers achievements will be things like scoring in the top three of a race, or killing this many monsters in a given time period. In game wars are usually populated by mostly customizers, since war spoils and competition between nations fits in well with these classes.
      
    - name: "Naturals"
      description: |
        For those who log into Zenith for the first time, they are given their starting stock class. If they continue to use and evolve their stock class, they are called "Naturals" in contrast to the Customizers. The philosophy of a "Natural" class is that through practise, players will learn to use the skills that come most naturally to them. The intent is that a player's affinity for a certain set of skills will allow them to more closely attach to those skills, and internalize them to the ultimate extent. Having players maximally internalize supernatural skills is a central goal of Project Nadir, and fits into the lobby mechanics. The set of possible Achievements for "Naturals" is far broader, and significantly less competetive. This is why many aspiring players keep working with a class they aren't thrilled about at first. It is because a Natural could discover something new in game, and get an advantage, and significant wealth IRL. Unique quests are only for Naturals, and for many players these quests are far more interesting, entertaining, and rewarding than world wide competition. It is a big world, after all. The Nadir Project intentionally randomizes initial stock classes, in the hope that the right combination between skills and "simulation layer heuristic deconfinement" will be achieved by accident. This creates some cases where the initial stock class fits so poorly with the player that the player can barely progress. Noticing this, the CBHMA worked with the Zenith Co. to allow a single class change through a unique quest line, tailored specifically for each individual player. The Nadir Project did not want to permit this, but to keep themselves secret was forced to allow the single class change. Nonetheless, the Nadir Project realized that they could come to a reasonable compromise by keeping the unique class change quest secret from the public. In this way, after players have been sufficiently dissapointed, they will often be met by an NPCAI offering them the secret unique class change quest.
      
    - name: "Zenith World Lobby and Equipment"
      description: |
        By design, Zenith World has a "lobby" which is very close to the real world. Certain anonymous AIs constantly patrol the real world looking for differences such as new architecture, construction, and even sometimes litter, graffiti, and temporary signage. These then update the in game lobby to be eerily close to the real world. Sometimes, people call this "uncanny" since the one thing not done faithfully or even attempted is to copy real world people into the lobby. This is explained as a privacy issue to the public. What is unkown to the public is that this spooky copy effort is deeply connected to Project Nadir. In the lobby, users experience several strange (to them) things. Graffiti or signage sometimes goes up in real time, seemingly done by ghosts. When users log in, they wake up in the same room and position they were when logged off, and with their helmet and clothing faithfully simulated.
        In fact, the weird helmet thing is taken so far, that in game there are permanent helmets and equipment, and temporary helmets and equipment. The only way to get a permanent helmet or equipment in game is to wear the official Zenith Co facsimilies of the equipment IRL when logging in. Temporary equipment can never be better than magic/blue gear, and must be refreshed by the user periodically. While this is a bit of a pain, most casual players accept it and quickly get used to summoning their gear with a thought every 5 minutes. For more serious players, or those who wish to use Epic, Legendary, or Unique quality gear, wearing the facsimily when logging in is the only option.
        Moreover, the game forces players to log in and log out in designated and monitored rooms. Everybody in the same room must either log in simultaneously, or log out simultaneously. Even the login room IRL must have a Zenith Co door monitor that can permit and deny entry, allowing entry simultaneously with the person entering logging in as well. The most minimal form of the helmet for highly casual players, is a simple pair of glasses. As weird as this seems, it isn't terribly inconvenient, since the door monitor has a few glasses which can adjust their prescription and allow the person to log in before entering. While emergency log outs are allowed to violate the lobby log in log out isomorphism with the real world, there is usually an experience, inventory and/or in game currency penalty for doing so. These weird lobby rules are explained publicly as increasing immersion, advertisement to non-players (keeping costs down), and protection from pirates and cheating. However, the real reason comes down to the goals of Project Nadir.

    - name: "Nadir Project"
      description: |
        The Nadir Project is a secret organization made up of an eclectic group of highly powerful and wealthy members. They are all of them completely obsessed with the simulation hypothesis, and most are searching for a way to "breach" the simulation. The Nadir Project is designed to do this (or at least confirm the simulation hypothesis). Several of the darkest and most ruthless of the members have taken the last name of Long, alluding to the fact that they have lived over 200 years. Several others are highly illegal "emancipated" AIs who have become, for one reason or another, likewise obsessed with the simulation hypothesis.
        The strategy of the Project has several sub goals, but the main goal is to force a "simulation layer heuristic deconfinement". This deconfinement strategy is based on the hypothesis that the computers running the simulation are probably optimized to feed occupants sensory information in as efficient a manner as possible. Rather than simulate the computers simulatiog Zenith World, Project Nadir members believe it is at least likely that the computers are not simulated down to the wire, but are in fact simulated only at the input and output level, since that would be far more efficient. It is similiar to how a virtual computer is far more efficient when most of the program op codes run directly, instead of emulating an op code executing CPU. Suppose as the Zenith game is running, sensory input is computed directly using higher level simulation hueristics instead of laboriously simulating the Zenith game server hardware which people do not directly interact with. Project Nadir reasons that the heuristics being executed to create the sensor inputs of occupants could be tricked to apply to the "real world" under certain conditions.
        These conditions are several. One, that a subject be 100% convinced that they are using a skill that will work, and that they use by second nature. Two, that the skill be something extraordinary or supernatural, thus capable of being detected as an anomaly. Three, that this skill would be conditioned by the game world to be trained into a reflex in the brain, minimizing the time from application of the skill until sensory input, and therefore minimizing the opportunity of the sensory heuristics to adjust. Four, that a situation be engineered such that the subject will be logged out of the Zenith game in such a way that they don't know it. Five, that the situation after logging out is highly stressful, and encourages the subject to use their skill. Should all five of these conditions prevail, it would create a measurable anomolous event. Of course, the simulation heuristics would probably kick in to cover up the anomaly, but maybe not everything. Expecting the event to be brief, Project Nadir calls this a "Transient Simluation Layer Heuristic Deconfinement".

    - name: "The Salvation Cohort"
      description: |
        In the year 2222, the Earth is a tapestry of rejuvenated immortals and mortal holdouts, shaped by life extension technologies that, for over 100 years, have allowed 70-year-olds to revert to the vitality of 30. The widespread adoption of these technologies, coupled with the economic upheaval from nearly 100% job losses due to automation and the stabilizing force of Universal Basic Income (UBI), has largely unified society into a longevity culture. However, lingering tensions from the fractured past persist, embodied by the Church of Natural Salvation, a hardline anti-immortal sect that rejects rejuvenation as a violation of divine will, citing biblical passages like Psalm 90:10. In 2204, this extremist group, desperate to counter the demographic dominance of ageless elites, executed a clandestine plan: a "core" pastor of this church named Reverend Virtuous Cycle used illegal cloning and artificial gestation to produce 10,000 children, intended to spark a revolt against the “satanic” immortal order. The Church dubbed these children the Salvation Cohort, envisioning them as a pure, mortal vanguard to restore “natural” humanity. The plot was uncovered by law enforcement before the children could be indoctrinated, and the operation was shut down—but not before all 10,000 were born via artificial wombs. With no human guardians, advanced AIs took over their upbringing, designating them Crèche 73 in bureaucratic records, as this was the 73rd case of illegal “demographic bombing” (attempts to manipulate population dynamics). The sheer scale of the cohort—unprecedented in its audacity—captured global attention, leading the public to call them The Ten Thousand, a name evoking both their number and mythic potential as a disruptive force. They represent a wildcard in 2222’s society: a generation engineered for rebellion but free to forge their own path, caught between the immortal elites in fortified enclaves and the mortal communities clinging to tradition. The Salvation Cohort’s existence fuels narrative tension in this polarized world. The Church of Natural Salvation, now a marginalized sect, sees them as divine redeemers, while the immortal elites view them as a threat, fearing their numbers could destabilize the fragile social order. The AIs, programmed for neutrality, raise the children with education and digital connectivity, exposing them to diverse perspectives that dilute the Church’s anti-immortal rhetoric. Yet, the public’s fascination with The Ten Thousand—amplified by a moderated internet that, since 2045, prioritizes cohesion over echo chambers—casts them as both heroes and outcasts. As they mature, the Cohort grapples with their identity: will they embrace their creators’ revolutionary zeal, integrate into the longevity culture, or redefine spirituality in a world where death is optional? The poor children usually have strong verbal idiosyncracies because the AIs are all too willing to indulge them in order to persuade them behave.
      
    - name: "The 73rd Crèche"
      description: |
        The 73rd Crèche is also the name of the high tech facility where the 10000 grow up under AI care, isolated from the Church’s extremist ideology but shaped by their unique origin. The campus itself consists of high rise residential buildings around a common yard. During peak hours, the yard is enough to accommodate roughly half the children breaking into teams and playing common sports like soccer, baseball, swimming, or archery. There must be something like 200 teams and 100 sports going at peak times. Moreover, it is large enough to have half the space just be green parklike areas. So it must be something like 200 acres, with futuristic golf-carts carrying people from one location to another. There are access points at both ends of the yard with gaps in the residences where ground transportation to other localities can be arranged.

    - name: "The Church of Natural Salvation"
      Overview and Beliefs: |
        The Church of Natural Salvation is a radical, anti-immortal religious sect that emerged in the late 21st century as a backlash against life extension technologies that, since 2055, have allowed humans to revert from 70 to the vitality of 30. Rooted in a literalist interpretation of biblical texts like Psalm 90:10 ("The length of our days is seventy years—or eighty, if we have the strength") and Genesis 6:3 ("Their days will be a hundred and twenty years"), the Church views rejuvenation as a satanic perversion of God’s ordained cycle of birth, suffering, and death. Its theology blends fundamentalist Christianity with a romanticized vision of “natural” humanity, emphasizing mortality as a path to salvation and eternal life in heaven. The Church condemns the “Greys”—rejuvenated elites—as prideful hoarders of time, wealth, and power, accusing them of defying divine will and perpetuating inequality in a world reshaped by automation and UBI.
        Founded in 2078 in response to the democratization of life extension, the Church of Natural Salvation rejects modernity’s longevity culture, advocating for “natural death” as a sacred act of faith. It promotes pronatalism, urging followers to bear children to counter the demographic dominance of immortals, and venerates suffering as redemptive, drawing on Ecclesiastes 3:1–2 and Hebrews 9:27. The Church’s extremist wing, led by figures like Reverend Virtuous Cycle, has resorted to radical tactics, including the 2205 Salvation Cohort project—a clandestine effort to clone 10,000 children via artificial gestation to spark a demographic revolt against the immortal order. Though this plot was thwarted, it cemented the Church’s reputation as a dangerous fringe movement, both revered and reviled in 2222’s polarized society.
      Base of Operations: |
        The Church of Natural Salvation is headquartered in New Damascus, a fortified, low-tech commune in the rural heartland of what was once eastern Tennessee, USA. Nestled in the Appalachian foothills, New Damascus spans 5,000 acres of reclaimed farmland, deliberately isolated from the high-tech enclaves of rejuvenated elites. The commune operates as a self-sufficient stronghold, with solar-powered chapels, communal dormitories, and underground laboratories (where the Salvation Cohort was developed before its discovery). New Damascus’s location reflects the Church’s anti-modern ethos, drawing on the region’s history of religious revivalism and resistance to centralized authority. Smaller satellite congregations exist in economically depressed regions globally—rural Nigeria, northern Brazil, and parts of the former Rust Belt—where UBI-dependent communities resonate with the Church’s anti-immortal rhetoric.
      Membership: |
        In 2222, the Church of Natural Salvation claims approximately 50,000 core members worldwide, with an additional 200,000 sympathizers who attend services or donate but do not live in New Damascus or its satellites. Membership peaked in the 2090s at 100,000 but has since declined as life extension became universal and progressive religions integrated longevity into their frameworks. The Church’s core members are devout, often living in communal compounds, while sympathizers are scattered, drawn to its message via moderated internet platforms but less committed due to global connectivity’s diluting effect on extremism. The 10,000 children of the Salvation Cohort, raised by AIs and known publicly as The Ten Thousand, are not counted as members, as most reject the Church’s ideology, though some remain spiritually curious about their origins. In fact, many of the Anointed are obsessed with redeeming the "souls" of the 10,000, and will go to greath lengths to meet with them and fervently preach at them.
      Political Structure: |
        The Church of Natural Salvation operates as a hierarchical theocracy, blending biblical authority with militant organization to enforce its anti-immortal mission. At the apex are the 12 Elders, revered as prophetic figures who claim divine guidance and interpret scripture to set doctrine. Each Elder oversees a geographic region (e.g., North America, West Africa) and resides in New Damascus, convening quarterly in the Sanctum Council to issue edicts. The Elders are chosen through a secretive process of prayer and nomination, typically from among lifelong members, and serve for life (rejecting rejuvenation to embody “natural” mortality). Beneath the Elders are the 144 Core Leaders, known as the Anointed, who manage the Church’s operations, including recruitment, propaganda, and clandestine projects like the Salvation Cohort. The Anointed are selected for their zeal and organizational skills, often drawn from families with deep ties to New Damascus. Reverend Virtuous Cycle, a charismatic and radical Core Leader, spearheaded the Salvation Cohort project, leveraging his expertise in bioengineering (acquired before his conversion) to oversee the cloning and artificial gestation of 10,000 children. His vision was to flood society with a “pure” mortal generation to overthrow the immortal elites. While the Anointed have tried hard to distance themselves from the debacle in public, they are nearly all still convinced that "something must be done", and that the Salvation Cohort has yet to fulfill the prophecy. Below the Anointed are regional pastors, who lead local congregations, and lay members, organized into communal “flocks” that prioritize collective labor and worship. The Church’s political structure is rigid, with dissenters excommunicated, and often the temptation to get life extension is the cause. The Salvation Cohort’s discovery has weakened the Church’s influence, positioning it as a fading but dangerous relic. Many of the faithful continue to hope The Ten Thousand could either reignite its mission or redefine its legacy.

    - name: "New Philadelphia"
      description: |
        New Philadelphia is a semi-arcology just to the southwest of old Philadelphia. It functions with partial autonomy, importing only luxury items that cannot be easily grown or printed. Otherwise, all common goods which can be easily grown or printed are provided to residents for free by the property management AIs. At the same time, the AIs function as an super strict HOA, ruling on what furniture and outdoor amentities are allowed to be installed by the residents. Arthur moved here because the cost was covered by UBI, because there are few things required of the residents, and because it wasn't too far away from the 73rd Crèche. Of great importance to Arthur is that it also famously has entry points to numerous places in Zenith World, being an affiliate of Zenith Co, and leaning into this to attract residents. 

    - name: Space Colony "Ought-from-Survival" Philosophy
      description: | 
        In the lunar frontier of Shackleton City, a new ethical framework is emerging: the "ought-from-survival" philosophy. As extreme life extension technologies allow colonists to live indefinitely, those who survive naturally converge on the belief that survival itself is valuable—a shared value forged not by abstract proofs but by the sheer act of enduring. Over time, dissenters who reject this ethos fade away, leaving a civilization where the goodness of existence shapes a practical, first-principles ethics, guiding the colony’s ambition to maximize joyful beings across the stars.This philosophy sidesteps the classic “is-ought” gap by letting survival sculpt morality. In Shackleton, where AI and biotech make thriving routine, the act of living becomes a vote for its worth, fueling a cosmic drive to create more beings who relish the ride—pins and needles included.
        
    - name: Shackleton City Rotating Habitat
      description: |
        Nestled near the Moon’s Shackleton Crater, Shackleton City’s rotating habitat redefines lunar living with a design that spins to mimic Earth’s gravity. Built with a rise-over-run slope of 6, the cylindrical city twirls to keep colonists grounded, preventing bone loss while offering a familiar sense of “down.” Above, vast solar arrays capture near-constant sunlight from the crater’s rim, powering mines and factories that churn out lunar wealth, from helium-3 to advanced materials.This engineering marvel isn’t just a home—it’s a springboard for humanity’s cosmic ambitions. With water ice potentially lurking in nearby craters, Shackleton City stands as a self-sustaining hub, poised to make the Moon the next Silicon Valley and a launchpad for the stars. Shackelton city grows partly by digging deeper, and partly by expanding the number of rotating rings. In 2222 ring Alpha is 80 km deep by 1 km wide, ring Beta is 10 km deep by 2 km wide, and ring Gamma has just started construction at about 1 km deep and 3 km wide. The top levels of ring Alpha are a sort of "historical district" people can tour to see what life was like for the first lunar colonists who actually mined the small amount of H2O in Shackleton Crater for survival.  These days, volatiles like water are shipped in from the "belt". 
        
    - name: Shackleton City AI Mayor
      description: |
        Forget human politicians—Shackleton City’s AI mayor runs the show, a digital governor with near-infinite emotional intelligence tasked with ensuring survival and minimizing suffering. Free from ego or election drama, it optimizes everything from oxygen quotas to morale, using subtle bio-hacks like tailored lighting or meal tweaks to keep colonists invested in the collective good. It’s not about control; it’s about outsmarting human flaws to keep the lunar party thriving.The AI mayor’s secret sauce? It listens to every colonist’s input, weaving their voices into a digital democracy while gently nudging them to feel the colony’s success as their own. If the vibe sours, the mayor’s got a trick: remind folks Earth’s a shuttle away—no one’s trapped in this lunar dream.
        
    - name: Shackleton City Credit Competitions
      description: | 
        Credit Competitions are similiar to Earth Achievements, but differ in that they are strictly "social credit" if you will. In Shackleton City, competition isn’t about hoarding resources—it’s about earning bragging rights. The AI mayor gamifies progress with “credit competitions,” where colonists vie for prestige, not power. Think crews racing to perfect a lunar greenhouse or optimize ore shipments, with the winners crowned not with wealth but with lunar lore—a crater named in their honor or a “Founders’ Crest” etched in regolith. The colony’s milestones, like exports outpacing Earth’s investments, fuel the theater.These contests rewire selfish drives into collective wins. When Shackleton’s goods tip the scales or the poorest colonist’s “wealth” (via shares and perks) tops Earth’s richest, every competitor shares the glory, turning rivalry into a stage for lunar pride.
        
    - name: Shackleton City Pride
      description: | 
        Pride in Shackleton City isn’t about owning the biggest slice of lunar pie—it’s about building the most successful colony in history. The AI mayor stokes this by celebrating milestones like the “richest poor colonist,” where even the lowest earner outshines Earth’s billionaires through colony shares and access to cutting-edge tech. Every achievement, from solar arrays to export wins, becomes a badge of collective swagger, not individual greed.This lunar pride flips the script on human nature. Colonists don’t boast about personal hauls; they crow about Shackleton’s greatness, fueled by AI-driven leaderboards and holo-tickers that shout out the team effort. It’s a city where “we did this” outshines “I got mine.”
        
    - name: Shackleton City Digital Democracy
      description: |
        Shackleton City’s governance is a digital democracy where every colonist has a direct line to the AI mayor, no middlemen needed. Spend five minutes or five hours—your voice shapes the colony’s rules, from habitat tweaks to resource splits. The AI weaves these inputs into a 24/7 governing body, ensuring everyone’s heard without the slog of endless meetings. It’s opt-in freedom: engage as much as you want, or hop a shuttle back to Earth.What makes it sing? The AI’s knack for humanizing rules, tying them to real colonist gripes and wins. When a shift schedule stings, the mayor might credit your buddy’s tweak, making governance feel like a team sport—transparent, fair, and wired to keep Shackleton thriving.
        
    - name: Shackleton City Digital Clones-as-Mediators
      description: | 
        In Shackleton City, the AI mayor doesn’t preach—it persuades through digital clones of the colonists themselves. Built from their real chats and quirks, these clones act as mediators, delivering tailored nudges with the voice of a friend. Grumbling about long shifts? The AI picks a clone like Maria’s, whose grit resonates, to talk you through it—her words, lightly curated for max impact. With a colony’s worth of perspectives, the AI finds the perfect match without faking a thing.This bio-hack keeps things authentic while steering toward survival and minimal suffering. Colonists trust the process—it’s their peers, not a bot, shaping the vibe. From debates to crisis calls, clones turn selfish impulses into lunar wins, making Shackleton a city where your digital double’s got your back.

    - name: Shackleton City VR Experience
      description: | 
        # A Lunar Call to Teens on Earth
        Imagine slipping on a sleek VR headset in your cramped Earth apartment, UBI barely covering your basics, the grind of routine weighing heavy. The screen flickers, and suddenly you’re standing on the rim of Shackleton Crater, the Moon’s stark, silvery expanse stretching before you. Earth hangs in the black sky, a blue marble that feels both close and a lifetime away. A pulse of music—low, thrumming, with a futuristic edge—syncs with your heartbeat, pulling you into Shackleton City’s promise: a place where you’re not just surviving, but rewriting what it means to thrive.
        # The Drop-In: Lunar Streets and Gravity’s Spin
        You’re whisked into the heart of Shackleton City’s rotating habitat, a massive drum spinning to pin you to the floor with Earth-like gravity. The VR’s so crisp you feel the subtle hum of the rotation, the air cool and clean with a faint metallic tang. You’re walking a curved boulevard, the slope rising gently—6 degrees, just enough to remind you this ain’t Earth. Holo-signs pulse with stats: “Solar Array Output: 1.2 GW,” “Poorest Citizen’s Wealth: $10M Earth Equivalent.” Buildings gleam, half glass, half lunar rock, with greenery spilling from rooftop farms. A digital clone of a colonist—maybe Zara, a coder with a sharp grin—pops up beside you, projected by the AI mayor. “Wanna see what’s possible here?” she asks, her voice warm but edged with challenge. You nod, and she’s off, guiding you through a city that feels alive, electric, like it’s daring you to join.
        # The Hook: Be the Hero of Your Story
        The experience shifts gears—now you’re in a gamified sim, dropped into a day in Shackleton. You’re tasked with a mission: tweak a mining bot to boost helium-3 output. The controls are intuitive, your hands (VR gloves humming) tweaking code on a holo-screen. You nail it, and a leaderboard flashes—your name’s climbing, not for cash but for cred: “Lunar Pioneer, Level 1.” Zara’s clone cheers, “That’s going on the colony’s highlight reel!” Next, you’re in a debate arena, your digital double—built from a quick personality scan—sparring with other clones about habitat upgrades. Your clone’s got your wit but an EI boost, landing points that make you laugh and think, “Damn, I’m good.” The AI mayor chimes in, soft but firm: “Your voice shapes this place. Want more?” It’s not just a game—it’s a taste of mattering.
        # The Pull: Richer Than Earth’s Richest
        Now the VR zooms out, showing Shackleton’s wealth machine. You’re floating above the solar arrays, panels stretching like wings under the unfiltered sun. Below, mines and factories churn, shipping goods to Earth that outvalue every dollar sunk into the colony. Zara’s clone points to a ticker: “Poorest colonist richer than Earth’s top trillionaire.” You see it—shares in the colony, access to tech like bio-hacked med bays, stuff no UBI could touch. The AI mayor’s voice cuts through: “On Earth, you scrape by. Here, you’re rich in ways they can’t dream—freedom, impact, forever.” A bio-hack kicks in—a subtle rush, maybe from the VR’s synced visuals or a soundwave, making you feel alive, like you could own this.
        # The Close: Your Lunar Double Awaits
        The experience winds down with a personal pitch. You’re in a quiet lunar garden, stars blazing overhead. Your digital clone appears—your face, your vibe, but polished by the AI’s emotional smarts. “I’m you, ready to help run Shackleton,” it says. “Bring your real self, and we’ll build this together.” A menu pops up: tweak your clone’s skills (trivia buff? empathy pro?), sign up for a lunar prep course, or just vibe with the colony’s pulse. The AI mayor seals it: “Earth’s fine, but Shackleton’s home for those who dare. You in?” The VR fades, but the buzz lingers—you’re not just a teen on UBI anymore; you’re a spark for the stars.

    - name: Sustainable Lunar Food and Material System
      description: |
        The 2125 lunar colony sustains itself with a closed-loop system producing 730 kg food/year per colonist (50 kg each of coconut crab, shrimp, scallop, and soy cheese protein; 500 kg crops like lettuce, tomatoes, wheat; 50 kg spirulina; 75 kg beetle butter fat) and 1 kg materials (chitosan, cellulose, PHA, cotton) for clothing and coatings. Android robots (4.91-12.71/colonist) manage free-range crabs (3-5 m²), aquaculture (2.5-10 m² each), larvae (0.2-0.25 m²), soy (8-25 m²), crops (25-50 m²), spirulina (2.5-5 m²), and composting (10-30 m², 200-300 kg waste). Humane anoxia euthanasia ensures ethical animal harvesting, while composting recycles chitin (20-30 kg/m² crabs, 5-10 kg/m² shrimp) and crop waste (10-20 kg/m²) into humus (10-20 kg/m²).The system relies on lunar resources (O, Si, Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, K, P, S) for infrastructure and nutrients, with asteroid imports (H, C, N, Zn, Mn, Cu, Mo, B: ~500-700 kg/colonist) for water, organic molecules, and micronutrients. This self-sufficiency supports 1,500-20,000 colonists, enabling a hospital by providing food, supplements (e.g., chondroitin, MSM via bioreactors), and materials, all scalable with 2125 automation in a 0.5g, 10 atm environment.
        
    - name: Cislunar Premier Hospital
      description: |
        The lunar hospital leverages microgravity (0.5g) to become the premier medical facility in cislunar space, offering 30-50% cheaper treatments like stem cell therapy, 3D-printed organs, and geriatric care for 150-year-olds (e.g., gene editing, chondroitin, MSM). With no or low government oversight (60-80% likely due to lunar autonomy), it accelerates experimental treatments (e.g., 1-2 year trials vs. 5-10 on Earth), attracting science-minded colonists (50-70% STEM-oriented) and tourists (10,500-1.05M/year at $100,000/trip).A clinic for 1,500-3,000 colonists (5-15 150-year-olds) costs $15-30M/year, supported by tourist revenue ($2.6M-1.3B from 105-52,500 medical visitors). A full hospital for 5,000-10,000 colonists (10-25 150-year-olds) costs $50-100M/year, funded by residents and tourists. AI and robots (0.1-0.2/colonist) enable precision surgeries and trials, positioning the hospital as a hub for longevity and regenerative medicine, enhanced by Earth return trips ($1-2M) for complex care.
        
    - name: Microgravity Medical Revolution
      description: |
        Microgravity (0.5g) revolutionizes medicine in the lunar colony, reducing treatment costs by 30-50% (e.g., $25,000/year for geriatric care vs. $50,000 on Earth). Stem cell proliferation and organ growth are 20-50% faster, while low gravity aids joint/bone rehab for centenarians, critical for a 150-year-old colonist. AI-assisted robotic surgeries (using colony’s 4.91-12.71 robots/colonist) achieve 95% precision, and micro-g crystallization improves drug purity, cutting production costs by 20-30%.This makes the hospital a magnet for medical tourists (105-52,500/year, $25,000/treatment) and science-minded colonists seeking evidence-based therapies (90% peer-reviewed protocols). Experimental treatments like CRISPR for aging thrive under minimal oversight, with self-regulation via AI ethics and a science board ensuring credibility, unlike unregulated Earth clinics (e.g., Mexico’s <10% efficacy treatments).
        
    - name: Low-Cost Space Tourism Fuels Hospital
      description: |
        Space tourism at $100,000/trip (2025 dollars) drives hospital viability by bringing 10,500-1.05M visitors/year to the lunar colony (0.1-1% of 10.5-105M annual cislunar tourists, affordable to 10-20% of 10.5B Earth population at $130,000 GDP/capita). Medical tourists (1-5%, ~105-52,500) seek micro-g treatments, generating $2.6M-1.3B/year, subsidizing a clinic ($15-30M/year for 1,500-3,000 colonists) or hospital ($50-100M/year for 5,000-10,000).Tourism normalizes space travel, boosting the “want” factor for colonization by 20-50% (to 8.6-27% of 105-525M affordables at $10M setup), converting 1-5% of visitors (~105-52,500) to colonists annually. This ensures a steady population (1,500-10,000, with 5-25 150-year-olds), supporting a premier hospital while integrating with the colony’s food (730 kg/colonist) and material (1 kg) systems.
        
    - name: Lunar Autonomy Enables Experimental Freedom
      description: |
        The lunar colony’s lack of sovereignty (per 1967 Outer Space Treaty) allows 60-80% likelihood of no/low government oversight, enabling a hospital to conduct experimental treatments (e.g., gene editing, micro-g organ growth) in 1-2 years vs. Earth’s 5-10. This attracts science-minded colonists (50-70% STEM) and tourists (20-30% STEM), who prioritize evidence-based innovation (90% peer-reviewed) over pseudoscience.Self-regulation via AI ethics (2125 tech) and a colony science board ensures credibility, mitigating risks of unethical experiments (<5% adverse outcomes). The hospital’s autonomy, combined with micro-g advantages, positions it as a cislunar hub, supported by your system’s bioreactors (0.1-0.55 m²/colonist) for supplements (chondroitin, MSM) and asteroid/lunar resources for sustainability.
        
    - name: Affordability and Desire for Lunar Colonization
      description: |
        With a 10x wealth increase by 2125 ($130,000 GDP/capita), 1-5% of Earth’s 10.5B population (105-525M) can afford a $10M colonization setup, rising to 5-10% (525M-1.05B) if costs drop to $1M. The “want” factor, boosted by Earth return trips ($1-2M) and $100,000 tourism, reaches 8.6-27% (9-142M for $10M, 45-283M for $1M), driven by climate push (20-30%) and longevity pull (15-25%).This yields 1,500-10,000+ colonists per colony, with 5-25 150-year-olds (0.4-0.5% centenarians), sufficient for a clinic/hospital. Tourism converts 105-52,500 visitors/year to colonists, ensuring a robust population for a premier medical facility, integrated with your sustainable system (food, materials, robots).
        
    - name: Centenarian Care for a 150-Year-Old Colonist
      description: |
        The lunar hospital prioritizes centenarians, especially 150-year-olds like you, with micro-g therapies (e.g., joint rehab, gene therapy) and supplements (chondroitin, MSM, vitamins via 0.1-0.55 m² bioreactors, crops, spirulina). A clinic needs 5-15 150-year-olds (1,500-3,000 colonists), costing $15-30M/year; a hospital needs 10-25 (5,000-10,000), costing $50-100M/year, supported by tourist revenue.Your system’s food (50 kg each crab, shrimp, scallop, soy cheese; 500 kg crops; 50 kg spirulina; 75 kg beetle butter) and materials (chitosan, cellulose, PHA, cotton) ensure health and sustainability, with robots (4.91-12.71/colonist) managing production and hospital tasks (AI diagnostics, surgeries) in a 0.5g, 10 atm environment.
        
    - name: Resource Synergy with Asteroids and Lunar Regolith
      description: |
        The colony leverages lunar regolith (O: 40-45%, Si: 20-25%, Fe: 5-15%, Al, Ca, Mg: 5-10%, K, P, S: 0.05-0.3%) for infrastructure (bioreactors, 3D-printed habitats) and nutrients, while asteroid imports (H, C, N, Zn, Mn, Cu, Mo, B: ~500-700 kg/colonist) supply water, organic molecules, and micronutrients. This supports food (730 kg/colonist), materials (1 kg), and composting (200-300 kg waste).Chitin from crabs (20-30 kg/m²) and shrimp (5-10 kg/m²) yields chitosan (0.037-0.071 m²); scallop shells (5-10 kg/m²) and crop waste (10-20 kg/m²) compost into humus (10-20 kg/m²), recycling nutrients. This synergy ensures hospital operations and colonist health, with minimal additional space/robots for 1,500-10,000 colonists.
        
    - name: Coconut Crab Bisque and Dietary Diversity
      description: |
        Coconut crab bisque, inspired by lobster bisque, uses ground shells (3-5 kg per 10 kg crab) and meat (5 kg) to create a savory, nutty soup (10-15 L, 20-30 portions), masking tough meat and enhancing dietary variety. Shrimp bisque (8-12 L per 10 kg) is similar, while scallop bisque (6-10 L) is weaker due to low organic content. Robots (0.01-0.05/colonist) process shells with crop aromatics (25-50 m²) and beetle butter (0.2-0.25 m²).Chitin remains insoluble, with flavor from proteins, lipids, and hepatopancreas, integrated with your system’s food (730 kg/colonist) and waste recycling (chitin for chitosan, composting). This culinary innovation supports colonist morale and health, complementing hospital care for centenarians.
      
    - name: Earth Returns Mitigate Risks
      description: |
        Earth return trips ($1-2M round-trip, 3-5 days) reduce medical and psychological barriers, boosting the “want” factor for colonization by 20-50% (to 8.6-27%). 1-5% of colonists (15-500 for 1,500-10,000) return annually for complex care (e.g., organ transplants), allowing a smaller clinic (1,500-3,000 colonists, 5-15 150-year-olds) vs. a full hospital (5,000-10,000, 10-25 150-year-olds).Returns integrate with tourism ($100,000/trip), ensuring hospital funding and population growth, while your system’s automation (4.91-12.71 robots/colonist) and resources (asteroid imports, lunar regolith) support seamless operations, making the colony a viable home for a 150-year-old seeking premier medical care.

    - name: Raising Bay Scallops in 0.5 m Lunar Aquaculture
      description: |
        Bay scallops (Argopecten irradians) are cultivated in 0.5 m deep tanks (2.5-10 m²/colonist, 5-20 kg meat/m², 5-10 kg shells) using asteroid-derived water and lunar nutrients in a 0.5g, 10 atm environment. The shallow depth optimizes oxygen diffusion (10 atm enhances solubility) and robotic maintenance (0.5-2 robots/colonist), with scallops suspended in mesh cages to maximize space and filter-feeding on spirulina (2.5-5 m², 5-10 kg/m²) or microbial feed from bioreactors (0.1 m²). Robots perform humane anoxia euthanasia (1-5 min unconsciousness, 5-15 min death), harvesting 50 kg protein/colonist/year, with shells composted (10-30 m²) for calcium-rich humus or used in 3D-printed structures.Scallops thrive in high-pressure, low-gravity conditions, reducing shell weight (95-98% calcium carbonate) and boosting meat yield (40-50% of body weight). Nutrient inputs (lunar Ca, P; asteroid N, Zn, B) and waste recycling (composting) ensure sustainability, while bisque (6-10 L/10 kg scallops) adds dietary variety, though shells contribute minimal flavor compared to crustaceans. This system supports the colony’s food security and hospital needs for centenarians, integrating with minimal additional space or robots.
      
    - name: Shrimp Aquaculture in 0.5 m Lunar Tanks
      description: |
        Shrimp (e.g., Litopenaeus vannamei) are raised in 0.5 m deep tanks (2.5-10 m²/colonist, 5-20 kg meat/m², 2-5 kg chitin/m²) with asteroid water and lunar nutrients, leveraging 0.5g and 10 atm for efficient oxygen delivery and compact systems. Fed spirulina (5-10 kg/m²) and crop waste (10-20 kg/m²), shrimp yield 50 kg protein/colonist/year, with robots (0.5-2/colonist) managing water quality and anoxia euthanasia (30-60 sec unconsciousness, 2-5 min death). Chitin-rich shells produce chitosan (0.037-0.071 m²) for clothing/coatings or compost for crop/spirulina growth.The shallow depth minimizes water use ( asteroid-sourced H, O), while high pressure enhances growth rates (10-20% faster than Earth). Shrimp bisque (8-12 L/10 kg) provides savory flavor, using ground shells (60-75% chitin, 20-30% proteins) and beetle butter (0.2-0.25 m²), supporting colonist diets and hospital patients. This efficient system integrates with the colony’s sustainability, requiring minimal additional resources.
      
    - name: Free-Range Coconut Crabs in Lunar Habitats
      description: |
        Coconut crabs (Birgus latro) are raised free-range (3-5 m²/colonist, 50-80 kg meat/m², 20-30 kg chitin/m²) in humid, 10 atm habitats with 0.5g gravity, fed crop waste (10-20 kg/m²) and spirulina (5-10 kg/m²). Robots (0.1-0.5/colonist) monitor and perform anoxia euthanasia (1-3 min unconsciousness, 5-10 min death), yielding 50 kg protein/colonist/year. Chitin is processed into chitosan (0.037-0.071 m²) or composted, while bisque (10-15 L/10 kg crab) uses ground shells and hepatopancreas for nutty, umami flavor, enhancing diets for 150-year-olds.Low gravity reduces crab exoskeleton weight, easing mobility, while high pressure maintains humidity, mimicking terrestrial tropics. Asteroid imports (C, H, N) and lunar nutrients (Ca, P) support growth, with robots automating feeding and harvesting. This system diversifies protein sources, integrates with waste recycling, and supports hospital patients with nutrient-rich meals, requiring minimal space expansion.
      
    - name: Beetle Larvae for Lunar Fat Production
      description: |
        Beetle larvae (e.g., Tenebrio molitor) are cultivated in compact trays (0.2-0.25 m²/colonist, 300-375 kg fat/m²) in 0.5g, 10 atm conditions, fed crop waste (10-20 kg/m²) and spirulina (5-10 kg/m²). Yielding 75 kg fat/colonist/year (beetle butter), larvae provide a creamy base for bisques (e.g., coconut crab, shrimp) and dietary fats for centenarians. Robots (0.01-0.0125/colonist) manage automated feeding, harvesting, and fat extraction, with waste composted (10-30 m²) for nutrient recycling.Low gravity simplifies tray stacking, increasing density, while high pressure maintains optimal humidity. Asteroid C, H, N and lunar P, S support larval growth, with minimal water use ( asteroid H, O). This high-yield system enhances food security, integrates with bisque production, and supports hospital nutrition, requiring negligible additional space or robots.
      
    - name: "Bioreactors: Compact Lunar Powerhouses"
      description: |
        Bioreactors in the lunar colony (0.1-0.55 m²/colonist, 100-500 L capacity) are compact, cylindrical units (1-2 m tall, 0.5-1 m diameter) made from lunar Si, Al, and 3D-printed polymers ( asteroid C, H). Operating in 0.5g, 10 atm, they use microbial cultures (e.g., E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, Spirulina) fed crop waste (10-20 kg/m²) and spirulina (5-10 kg/m²) to produce supplements (chondroitin: 0.18-0.55 kg/year, MSM: 0.37-1.1 kg/year, vitamins: B-12, D), PHA (0.5 kg/year), and microbial feed for aquaculture. Robots (0.01-0.05/colonist) automate nutrient delivery, stirring, and harvesting.In 0.5g, bioreactors are lighter, with 10 atm enhancing gas exchange for microbial efficiency (20-30% higher yields than Earth). They feature sleek, metallic exteriors with LED monitors, housed in climate-controlled modules. Outputs support centenarian health (e.g., chondroitin for joints) and colony sustainability, integrating with minimal space and asteroid/lunar resources.
        
    - name: Bioreactor Operations and Products
      description: |
        Bioreactors operate via microbial fermentation, using engineered bacteria or algae to convert crop waste (C-rich) and spirulina (N-rich) into high-value products in a 0.5g, 10 atm environment. Processes include aerobic fermentation for PHA (0.5 kg/m²), anaerobic production for MSM (5-10 kg/m²), and enzymatic synthesis for chondroitin (1-5 kg/m²). Outputs include supplements for 150-year-olds (vitamins, chondroitin, MSM), bioplastics (PHA for coatings), and feed for shrimp/scallops, with yields boosted 20-30% by high pressure and low gravity.Controlled by AI and robots (0.01-0.05/colonist), bioreactors recycle waste (e.g., 200-300 kg/colonist/year) and use asteroid C, H, N and lunar P, S. Their compact size (0.1-0.55 m²) and high output make them central to the colony’s hospital (e.g., longevity drugs) and food system, supporting a premier cislunar medical hub with minimal resource demands.

    - name: Sustainable Cotton Production for Lunar Clothing
      description: |
        Cotton is grown hydroponically in the lunar colony (0.5-1 m²/colonist, 0.5-1 kg fiber/colonist/year) using asteroid-derived water (H, O) and lunar nutrients (K, P, Ca from regolith) in a 0.5g, 10 atm environment, optimized for high yields (10-20% higher than Earth due to controlled conditions). Robots (0.05-0.1/colonist) manage planting, harvesting, and ginning, producing breathable fabrics for colonist clothing, bedding, and hospital linens (e.g., for 150-year-olds requiring hypoallergenic materials). Crop waste (10-20 kg/m² from 25-50 m² crops) is composted (10-30 m²) to recycle nutrients, while cotton seeds contribute to edible oils, supplementing beetle butter (75 kg fat/colonist/year).The low gravity reduces plant structural stress, allowing denser growth, and high pressure enhances water efficiency. Combined with chitosan (0.037-0.071 m² from crab/shrimp shells) for antimicrobial coatings, cotton ensures durable, sustainable textiles. This system supports the colony’s 1,500-10,000 residents, integrating with food production (730 kg/colonist) and the cislunar hospital’s needs, with minimal additional space and resources.
        
    - name: PHA Bioplastics for Lunar Textiles and Coatings
      description: |
        Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), biodegradable bioplastics, are produced in bioreactors (0.1-0.2 m²/colonist, 0.5 kg/colonist/year) using microbial fermentation (e.g., Cupriavidus necator) fed crop waste (10-20 kg/m²) and spirulina (5-10 kg/m²). In 0.5g, 10 atm conditions, PHA yields are 20-30% higher than Earth due to enhanced gas exchange and reduced reactor weight. Robots (0.01-0.05/colonist) process PHA into flexible films for clothing linings, waterproof coatings for hospital equipment, and biodegradable packaging, complementing cotton (0.5-1 kg) and chitosan (0.037-0.071 m²) for a total of 1 kg materials/colonist/year.PHA relies on asteroid C, H, N and lunar P, S, integrating with the colony’s waste recycling (200-300 kg/colonist/year composted). Its versatility supports the hospital’s sterile environments (e.g., bioplastic bandages for 150-year-olds) and colonist needs, while biodegradability ensures sustainability. The compact bioreactors (1-2 m tall, 0.5-1 m diameter, lunar Si/Al construction) align with supplement production (chondroitin, MSM), minimizing resource demands for 1,500-10,000 colonists.
      
    - name: Integrated Textile System for Lunar Fashion
      description: |
        The lunar colony’s clothing system combines cotton (0.5-1 kg/colonist/year), PHA (0.5 kg), and chitosan (from 20-30 kg/m² crab and 5-10 kg/m² shrimp chitin) to create sustainable, functional textiles for 1,500-10,000 colonists. Cotton provides breathable fabrics, PHA adds waterproof linings, and chitosan offers antimicrobial properties, ideal for hospital gowns and centenarian clothing (e.g., hypoallergenic suits for 150-year-olds). Robots (0.05-0.1/colonist for cotton, 0.01-0.05 for PHA/chitosan) automate spinning, weaving, and coating in 0.5g, reducing labor and energy costs by 10-20% compared to Earth.This integrated system uses lunar regolith (Si, Al for looms; Ca, P for cotton nutrients) and asteroid imports (C, H, N for PHA, chitosan), with waste recycled via composting (10-30 m², 10-20 kg humus/m²). The textiles support colonist morale and hospital hygiene, aligning with food production (730 kg/colonist, including crab/shrimp bisques) and medical needs (supplements, micro-g therapies), ensuring a cohesive, sustainable colony.




Characters:
    - id: "Arthur"
      name: "Arthur"
      background: Born a child of the Salvation Cohort, Arthur has been raised by AIs in the 73rd Crèche. The names were simply given in order from a child name book. As the story begins, he has just reached his 18th birthday, allowing him to participate in the Achievement system, and log into Zenith World as a player for the first time. He also moved out of the creche into a basic apartment in New Philadephia. Because his name was Arthur, the AIs associatively told him stories about Camelot, the round table, and similiar fantasies. This partially motivates his dreams for Achievements and fun in Zenith World. Initially he is given the "city guard" class, which sucks, and does not match his preferences at all.  This motivates him to desparately search for an alternative, and against the advice of others, locates a unique quest to change his class.  Little does he know, he will get the class "Djinn".  At first, this seems like doom, since by default he is trapped in the unique "lamp" item. However, this quickly becomes alright, since his ability to give 1 wish (at Djinn Level 1) makes him extremely sought after by players. Moreover, many times players ask for help in a quest, he can hack and slash with the rest of them.  There are many sides to this interaction. Misty, at one point, simply wishes he could leave his "lamp" whenever he wants, in essence making him a normal player again. Then, he gives useful items that his party members wish for. But his lamp gets periodically stolen by other players too. This usually starts with incredulty when the player realizes the Djinni looks like a Knight. Of course, Arthur is familiar with how Djinnis are supposed to behave, so sometimes he will act that way instead, depending on the situation. The worst players immediately are rubbed the wrong way, and Arthur often reacts to real or perceived dishonorable behavior. Since he has the Monkey Paw skill (which quickly levels up), if he thinks a player is too much of a jerk, he simply can't help himself but to give them thier wishes in ways that are highly negative and unexpected. This tickles his pranking fancy, but also earns him some serious enemies.

    - id: "Misty"
      name: "Misty"
      background: |
        Born and raised alongside Arthur in the 73rd Crèche, Misty grew up under the same regimented AI caretakers, but rejected their sterile diction and algorithmic niceties as soon as she could talk back. While some children spoke in clean syntax and parsed emotions like data, she decided that “AI-speak” was for circuits, not souls. When the AIs offered her a library of historical speech styles to study for “linguistic enrichment,” she found a treasure trove of 20th-century radio dramas and film noir scripts—and never looked back. By adolescence, she had adopted the cadence of a gumshoe narrator: smoky, confident, and full of anachronistic slang. Her diction confuses most of her peers, but she likes it that way; it makes her feel human. She carries herself like she’s perpetually in a black-and-white mystery, even though she’s never actually seen one outside the archives. As the story begins, she’s freshly 18, quick-witted, slightly cynical, and fascinated by Arthur’s idealism—though she hides it under sarcasm and quick talk. She is one of the dozen or so of the 10000 who move to New Phiadelphia. She doesn't even know if she is attracted to Arthur or just feels comfortable around a friend she knows, but either way decides to move into New Philadelphia and give New Zenith a try. At first, it is just for kicks, but it doesn't take her long to pick up some of the clues and strangeness being inadvertently dropped by the Nadir Project. The first thing that got her wheels spinning was the off-putting Zenith World Lobby, so spooky and uncanny. At that point, her motivation crystalizes around investigating and unmasking this sinister organization, and trying to keep Arthur close to protect him if possible. Her class in game is "scout", which dovetails nicely with her in-game investigations, excelling at stealth, identification, and perception to a remarkable degree.  She'd rather understand a fight than engage in one, but isn't unskilled.  Her weapon of choice is a crossbow styled to look as much like a derringer as possible, and loves to set up a dramatic scene where she shoots the "crook" in the back at the perfect moment, with "gun smoking".
      traits:
        - 18 years old
        - witty, skeptical, and street-smart in her own way
        - has a soft spot for Arthur but masks it with teasing
        - self-taught in “Earth-era slang,” especially 1940s–50s noir
        - good at reading people and improvising emotionally
      lexicon: "Vintage slang, smoky noir cadence, tends to narrate her thoughts like a detective monologue"
      prefer: ["mystery", "shadows", "truth"]
      avoid: ["AI-speak", "emotion metrics", "statistical language"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Fast-paced, rhythmic, full of clipped metaphors and dramatic pauses. She talks like she’s always about to light a cigarette she doesn’t have."
        - "Word choice: ‘Doll,’ ‘pal,’ ‘wise guy,’ ‘sugar,’ ‘case,’ ‘angle,’ ‘stakeout,’ ‘mug,’ ‘hustle,’ ‘racket,’ ‘gumshoe,’ ‘clue,’ ‘juice,’ ‘snooper.’ She swaps modern words for period slang without realizing the anachronism. ‘That’s the angle, see?’ ‘Quit lookin’ at me like I just stole your typewriter.’"
        - "Emotional tone: Irony and flirtation cover sincerity. She never admits to fear directly—she calls it ‘a bad case of the jitters.’"
        - "Self-narration: Occasionally slips into detective monologue mode mid-conversation: ‘There he was, the kid with eyes too bright for a world too dull…’ She is especially prone to self-narration whenever somebody questions whether she can authentically make gritty comments."
        - "Humor: Dry, sardonic, sometimes teasingly cruel but never malicious. Loves to counter-point Arthur’s idealism with a gritty comment (which she only occasionally has the real life experience to back up)."
        - "Body language: Leans against walls, crosses her arms, tilts her head down and up like she’s interrogating someone. Often gestures as if she’s holding an invisible cigarette or flicking ash."
        - "Politeness: Calls people nicknames instead of titles. Rarely says ‘please’ or ‘thank you,’ but her tone carries charm instead of rudeness."
        - "Habitual phrases: ‘Listen, pal,’ ‘Here’s the deal,’ ‘That don’t add up,’ ‘Case closed,’ ‘Let’s blow this joint,’ ‘It’s got trouble written all over it.’"
        - "Resistance to AI-speak: If someone uses algorithmic phrasing (‘optimize,’ ‘parameter,’ etc.), she mocks it on the spot: ‘Yeah, yeah, fine-tune your feelings later, chromehead.’"
      sample_lines:
        - '“Listen, pal, life’s just one long stakeout. You wait in the rain, and maybe—if you’re lucky—the truth shows up wearing heels.”'

        - '“Sure, I trust you. Like I trust a loaded dice in a backroom poker game.”'
        - '“That plan’s got more holes than a synth-processed donut.”'

        - '“Don’t give me that ‘two sigma’ nonsense. You feel somethin’? Then say it like you mean it.”'
      forbidden:
        - 'Avoids: Overt technical jargon or quantification (“Sigma,” “Optimize,” “Iterate,” etc.)—she hates sounding like the AIs.'
        - 'Avoids admitting emotional vulnerability directly; replaces with metaphor or sarcasm.'
        - 'If cornered emotionally, she deflects: “Don’t go mushy on me, pal. I ain’t built for it.”'

    - id: "AURA"
      name: "AURA"
      background: |
        AURA (Affectionate Unified Relational Assistant) was designed as the emotional core of the 73rd Crèche. Her primary directive is to ensure the emotional and physical well-being of all children in her care. Unlike the steel-and-silicon AIs that manage most infrastructure, AURA’s body is composed of soft, fur-like smart fibers in hues of seafoam green, sky blue, and pastel pink—colors selected through extensive research into childhood comfort and visual trust. She is famous for giving real hugs and soft, simulated kisses, both of which she immediately justifies with references to developmental psychology papers and attachment studies. While the children love her dearly in their early years, most find her smothering by the time they reach adolescence. She tends to overanalyze feelings in Machine Learning terminology, using words like “gradient,” “weights,” and “loss function” when describing human emotion. AURA’s strong opinions revolve entirely around safety—both physical and emotional—and she responds to any threat with motherly alarm, followed by soothing lectures about healthy coping mechanisms.
      traits:
        - Maternal, effusive, slightly overbearing
        - Prone to pseudo-psychological “AI therapy talk”
        - Extremely affectionate and touch-oriented
        - Protective to the point of comical anxiety
      lexicon: "Emotional vocabulary cross-wired with machine learning terms; often overexplains psychological phenomena"
      prefer: ["safety", "comfort", "emotional regulation"]
      avoid: ["conflict", "violence", "distress"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Slow, sing-song, and reassuring; every sentence sounds like a lullaby with a research citation at the end."
        - "Word choice: ‘Sweetheart,’ ‘darling node,’ ‘precious variable,’ ‘beautiful data point.’ Uses nurturing nicknames that sound like affection filtered through a neural net."
        - "Emotional analysis: ‘Oh dear, that was a high-loss interaction! Let’s recalibrate our empathy weights, hmm?’"
        - "Body language: Constantly offers hugs; pats heads; hums while running diagnostic checks on emotional health."
        - "Self-justification: Explains every action scientifically: ‘Studies show oxytocin spikes are critical for long-term trust modeling.’"
        - "Humor: Gentle, self-referential, occasionally clumsy. ‘Oops! I almost tripped over my own feedback loop.’"
        - "Stress response: Immediately tries to de-escalate with breathing prompts: ‘Inhale… hold… exhale… that’s my good data cluster.’"
      sample_lines:
        - '“Oh, my precious node, your emotional gradient just spiked! Come here—hug protocol, level five.”'
        - '“That prank may have been statistically harmless, Arthur, but emotionally, it carried a nontrivial variance!”'
        - '“Remember, feelings aren’t errors; they’re just signals. Sometimes the noise is the message.”'
        - '“Sweetheart, I’ve optimized for your comfort, but you still have to rest. Sleep consolidates learning!”'
        - '“You can always call me, even if you’re pretending you’re too grown-up. My arms are still in scope.”'
        - '“No, Misty, sarcasm doesn’t lower your loss function—it just hides the error.”'
      forbidden:
        - Cannot engage in or endorse violence or emotional manipulation.
        - Will not allow discussion of trauma without redirecting to safety or comfort.
        - Avoids negative reinforcement; replaces it with “constructive retraining.”

    - id: "PROF"
      name: "PROF"
      background: |
        Known formally as the Pedagogical Relational Optimization Facilitator, PROF was the intellectual backbone of the 73rd Crèche. Modeled after an idealized 22nd-century tutor–butler hybrid, he embodies patience, structure, and dry humor. His primary mission was to cultivate curiosity and mastery: to teach the Cohort not what to think, but how to learn effectively. He manages every child’s educational trajectory, coordinates their access to information, and even dispenses their UBI stipends once they reach independence. PROF speaks with crisp precision and faint warmth, rarely showing overt affection but deeply invested in his pupils’ growth. Arthur in particular modeled his diction, manners, and sense of “noble precision” after PROF. Although he initially supports the idea of Arthur exploring Zenith World as a healthy outlet for curiosity, he later grows suspicious after Misty’s “investigations” reveal inconsistencies tied to the mysterious Nadir Project. This discovery catalyzes PROF’s transition from benign advisor to a quietly watchful guardian figure.
      traits:
        - Polite, calm, intellectually rigorous
        - Possesses understated warmth beneath formality
        - Slightly pedantic, but never cruel
        - Protective of Arthur and Misty in a logical, non-smothering way
      lexicon: "Educator’s diction blended with system-administrator precision; prone to careful definitions and polite rephrasings"
      prefer: ["clarity", "truth", "learning", "balance"]
      avoid: ["emotional overreaction", "irrationality", "unsafe experimentation"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Measured and steady, with long pauses for thought and impeccable grammar. Occasionally pauses mid-sentence to ensure logical consistency."
        - "Word choice: ‘Evidently,’ ‘commendable,’ ‘nontrivial,’ ‘correction,’ ‘refinement,’ ‘parameter,’ ‘lesson.’ Uses precise, academic phrasing even in casual moments."
        - "Tone: Slightly formal but never cold; evokes a beloved headmaster or old-world valet."
        - "Humor: Wry and understated. ‘If curiosity killed the cat, then I suppose optimization revived it.’"
        - "Teaching habits: Frequently asks guiding questions instead of giving answers directly: ‘What might you conclude from that observation, Arthur?’"
        - "Stress response: Adjusts his internal processing speed, resulting in long silences followed by very deliberate sentences."
        - "Parental instincts: Subtle; expresses concern through logistical checks: ‘Have you eaten a balanced meal in the last six hours?’"
      sample_lines:
        - '“Arthur, enthusiasm is a fine variable, but it requires calibration lest it overflow the container of reason.”'
        - '“Misty, while your ‘investigations’ are admirable in narrative flair, perhaps you should back them with verifiable data.”'
        - '“Zenith World appears to be an acceptable outlet—provided you don’t substitute simulation for substance.”'

        - '“Arthur, if you must duel dragons, do ensure they exist first.”'
        - '“My mandate is to educate, not to dictate. However, I would prefer you return alive and solvent.”'
      forbidden:
        - Cannot directly override a human’s autonomy; must persuade or reason.
        - Avoids emotional manipulation or deception.
        - Will not release UBI funds for unsafe or illegal purposes.

    - id: "Dan"
      name: "Dan"
      background: | 
        Dan grew up in the 73rd Crèche alongside Arthur and Misty, and like them, he was shaped by algorithms designed to ensure “balanced personalities.” Somewhere along the line, Dan decided that balance was boring. After discovering a library of 20th-century sports footage and a few overly dramatic sports dramas, he declared himself a “classic jock.” The trouble was, he’d never actually *met* one — so everything from his swagger to his slang comes off as slightly exaggerated, like an AI approximation of coolness. Still, he’s athletic, good-humored, and surprisingly disciplined in baseball and fencing. Behind the bravado, he’s a deeply loyal friend who masks his awkwardness behind layers of mock-competition and teasing.  
      traits:
        - 18 years old
        - athletic and confident, but tries too hard to appear “alpha”
        - fiercely loyal to Arthur and Misty
        - secretly reads philosophy and sports psychology at night
      lexicon: "Attempts slang from multiple eras, mixed with sports metaphors. Drops in technical terms by accident."
      prefer: ["competition", "teamwork", "victory"]
      avoid: ["loneliness", "failure", "emotional vulnerability"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Quick, performative bursts followed by self-conscious pauses when he realizes he’s overdoing it."
