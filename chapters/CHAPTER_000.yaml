      name: "73rd Crèche, Moving Day"
      description: |
        This is also the 18th Birthday of Arthur and Misty. The 73rd Crèche appears almost unreal under the morning sun — a miniature city of glass and greenery, built on a scale that dwarfs its inhabitants. The central yard stretches out like a living map, divided into zones of motion and stillness: half of it an explosion of organized chaos — fields, pools, and archery lanes alive with shouts and splashes — and the other half a quiet parkland of trees, benches, and broad lawns where remaining members of the cohort play pastoral games. From above, the whole 200-acre complex resembles a great neural net — paths and transit lines connecting the tall residential towers that rise around the perimeter, each tower home to thousands of children raised together under the same patient machinery of care. Futuristic golf-carts hum along the walkways, their transparent roofs glinting. They ferry children, boxes, and farewell hugs from dorm to dorm. The air carries the smell of wet grass and the faint metallic tang of distant irrigation drones.
        Near one of the loading bays, Arthur and Misty stand beside a sleek silver Creche Car, their luggage already stacked inside. Around them, the ambient hum of the crèche was oddly emotional: laughter from somewhere in the park, a farewell whistle, the soft voice of AURA murmuring something in the distance. The high-rises cast long, lattice-like shadows across the yard as they cast their gaze toward the pickup point. Above the noise, they can hear the rhythmic chime that meant the midmorning shift — signaling the next rotation of games, classes, and meals for those who stay behind. For Arthur and Misty, it is the sound of the world continuing without them. Above them, across the path which curves through a corridor of trees flys a bright synthetic banners fluttering an aspirational message: “Cohort 73 — Dream, Build, Explore.” A few kids wave from balconies above as the two figures wait the last few minutes, half hero, half ghost — leaving the only home they had ever known for the city that waits beyond.
    - actors: [Arthur, Misty]
    - narration: The Scene is 73rd Crèche, Moving Day.
    - explicit: Moving Day is also the birthday of all 10000 in the cohort.
    - implicit: A birthday is not as special when it is shared by 9999 other kids at the same time!
    - implicit: Arthur and Misty notice that they feel a nostalgic and slighly reluctant to go.
    - explicit: Arthur has only to think about Zenith World, and he is eager to move! 
    - implicit: Is logging into Zenith World really going to go as smoothly as Arthur hopes?
    - explicit: Arthur and Misty are waiting a few more minutes before riding the Creche car to meet with ground transportation to New Philadelphia.
    - actors: [Arthur, Misty, AURA]
    - explicit: AURA enters the scene.
    - explicit: AURA tries one more time to convince them to stay for the party.
    - explicit: AURA gives them each a half dozen chocolate chip cookies as a birthday gift.
    - implicit: Arthur feels the quests calling him NOW!
    - explicit: Misty thinks there is something afoot with Zenith World, and she is not going to let Arthur get sucked in without an objective observer present.
    - implicit: What if Zenith World hides dark secrets that Misty only thinks she is ready for?
    - actors: [Arthur, Misty, AURA, PROF]
    - explicit: PROF enters the scene.
    - explicit: PROF states how he is proud of them.
    - explicit: PROF and AURA both warn the kids about a laundry list of things.
    - explicit: PROF gives Arthur a virtual tour of Shackleton City on the moon, which is a plugin mod for the Zenith VR helmet.
    - implicit: What is the significance of Shackleton City for Aurthur and for PROF?
    - implicit: The virtual tour is a minor miracle even for the time, since it is interactive and can integrate with the Zenith World hardware. Third party hardware integrating with Zenith World hardware is not normally possible, but PROF is no ordinary AI. 
    - explicit: PROF gives Misty a modern version of an investigators notebook, which is a digital notebook with heads up display and software capability which can help her track clues and investigations.
    - implicit: This may be even more impressive, since it can even integrate with Zenith World software while logged in, maybe even violating the terms of service. 
    - explicit: PROF notices that the time has come to go.
    - explicit: Arthur and Misty say their goodbyes to AURA and PROF.
    - implicit: As usual, AURA is more prone to hugging, and definitely more prone to strange pet names, than an 18 year old might prefer.
    - actors: [Arthur, Misty]
    - implicit: Arthur and Misty embark in the Creche car, and watch the park scenery go by. 
    - implicit: Arthur and Misty see one of thier close friends, Dan, playing baseball.
    - explicit: Dan is not leaving until after the party, but is also going to join them in New Philadelphia and Zenith World.
    - explicit: Arthur and Misty load their luggage into the ground car, but Arthur grabs a package from his before they climb in.
    - scene: 
      name: "Drive to New Philadelphia"
      description: |
        The drive to New Philadelphia in the autonomous car takes the pair past acres and architectures both old and new. Roughly this is Charlottesville -> Staunton -> Harrisburg -> Philadelphia (to avoid travel through the Washington-Baltimore Magacity). They see anachronistic homesteads (some with nearly dissolved ancient internal combustion vehicles), run down appearance, and occasionally some very rustic appearing individuals in or about. They see fields full of "new" crops like supermaize and vitamin-lettuce. They also see the appalachian mountains off to the west for the main leg of the journey. Highways of the future are not completely different from today. In Philadelphia though, the highway is essentially a megastructure itself with many levels built into the sky, passing by a bewildering array of sky scrapers and other architectural wonders. None of these wonders compare to the New Philadelphia arcology they approach at the end of their journey.
    - actors: [Arthur, Misty, Car]
    - implicit: Cars in 2222 are all fully autonomous.
    - explicit: They silently watch the Creche recede in the distance.
    - explicit: Thier trip is about 150 miles to the north.
    - explicit: They being to see things that surprise them, like some run down little houses, and some agriculture that grows well in the vicinity of Philadelphia.
    - explicit: The package Arthur grabbed is a birthday present for Misty.  
    - explicit: Well actually, once Misty opens it, it is a Zenith VR headset.
    - implicit: Maybe it is as much a present for Arthur to have Misty log into Zenith later on.
    - implicit: Misty had actually guessed this exact thing would happen.
    - implicit: Misty didn't and still doesn't plan to bother with a gift, since you can't give 10000 gifts out every year.
    - explicit: They decide to play a few games of Tak while they travel. Misty wins all of them.
    - explicit: The New Philadelphia semi arcology comes into view. It is a pyramid with lovely green stripes covering much of its slopes, with organic shaped silvery patches covering the rest of its struture.
    - explicit: It keeps growning and growing in size.
    - explicit: |
        When it is obviously the size of a mountain, suddenly they realize: The green stripes are _forests_!
    - explicit: Arthur asks the car if they can wander on those forests.
    - explicit: The car responds that there are numerous balconies and flat areas where it is allowed, but also a lot of it is too steep to be safe.
    - implicit: After trying to wrap their minds around the scale, and sitting in awe, they arrive at the gate.
    - scene: 
      name: "New Philadelphia Arcology"
      description: |
        The New Philadelphia Arcology is roughly 5 km square at the base, and just as high.  It is pyramid shaped, covered about half with forest, and the other half silver windows allowing light to enter the arcology.  The massive building is hollow, as if another pyramid were removed from the inside, with a 3 km square "Mall" on the inside floor. The 1 km thick walls sloping up inside also have endless windows and balconies. Arthur, Misty, and Dan's level is 408, roughly 1/3 the way up, at oclock 501 (there are 1200 minutes around the circumference), block 7 out from the middle, apartments 7, 8 and 9. The mall is filled with parks, fountains, food and pastime vendors with a large number of roller coasters and water parks.  Slightly more serious shops for all sorts of immediate use are arrayed around the outside of the mall. Beyond those shops are the elevators and the circumferential motorized walkways. There is one elevator per minute going up and down, at the base, 2/3 of those go 1/3 up, 1/3 go 2/3 up, and only 1/20 go all the way to the top.  
    - actors: [Arthur, Misty, drone]
    - explicit: Arthur and Misty disembark through a security gate, and ride a moving walkway which runs quickly through a suprisingly long tunnel.
    - explicit: They are awed again by the massive mall they find inside, interspersed with tropical tree parks with a large variety of colorful birds.
    - explicit: The pyramid is partially hollow, with living areas interpersed with agricultural levels in the thick outer shell of the pyramid.  The layers can be observed from the ground mall level.
    - explicit: A hovering AI drone guide arrives and offers to lead them to their destination.
    - implicit: Is this really a place where sheltered youngsters can thrive?
    - explicit: The two agree, and they walk over to another moving walkway at the periphery of the mall. This escalator has progressively faster strips all moving clockwise around the base of the pyramid. This is something they have to get used to.
    - explicit: Finally, thier guide tells them they have arrived at the optimum elevator.  All the elevators go one way, each up elevator paired with a down elevator. This allows roughly 100 elevator cars to share the same tracks. Even so, there must be 1000 elevator pairs around the inside of the whole pyramid.
    - explicit: They ride the elevator up to the 408th floor, where they get off, and ride another moving walkway outward toward their apartment block.
    - explicit: The guide points out several restaurants with good reviews, and where the parks and gyms are located. 
    - explicit: The parks they pass by seem to have natural lighting, but the guide has to disspoint them that it is not.
    - implicit: This is actually the low rent high population density area, compared to higher up where the luxury is pretty unreal.
    - implicit: Are their neighbors going to be reasonable people?
    - explicit: Finally they arrive at thier apartment block, numbers 408.501.7.7, 408.501.7.8, and 408.501.7.9 (These being Arthur, Misty, and Dan's rooms, respectively).
    - explicit: Arthur eagerly walks up the auto butler door, and gains admittance. 
    - implicit: Is this a meager or generous apartment? The answer in the next chapter. 

Story-So-Far: |
    It is now Arthur's and Misty's 18th birthday. Well, it is the birthday of _everybody_ in the Creche, which practically feels like a universal holiday! They are now free to leave the Creche, and they are going to move to a semi arcology called New Philadelphia. They plan to move in before the day is out, and they can always come back to the Creche right? They will be logging in to Zenith world before you know it!

Story-Relative-To:
    Arthur: |
      Boy is Arthur ready to leave! He has been waiting for this day for so long, and now it has arrived. He isn't even willing to stick around to celebrate everybody's birthday party. He has saved up his descretionary funds in order to celebrate his birthday by logging into Zenith World for the first time. He can't wait to start scoring some of those juicy, juicy Achievements! Maybe he can even play a few harmless pranks while he is at it?
    Misty: |
      She is on the fence about leaving before the party, but she has decided to stick with Arthur for now. Well, to be neighbors at least. As for the party, she certainly isn't going to miss the stilted AI-speak of the other kids as they get emotional, and there aren't any real mysteries in the Creche. On the other hand, she suspects there might be some mysteries in Zenith World. At minimum, it deserves investigation on whether Zenith World is on the up and up. A natural thing to observe is the effect it will have on her longtime childhood friend!
    Dan: | 
      He is playing baseball, and will join the big birthday party with everybody else. Dan isn't really bothered that Arthur and Misty won't be there, since he is going to move tomorrow and see them then. Maybe he will notice when they leave, but maybe not. 
    AURA: |
      She has known about Arthur and Misty's plans for some time, and has argued that the Creche is a happier place than Zenith World. She wishes they would at least stay for the Birthday party.
    PROF: |
      Also knows Arthur and Misty's plans, and is on balance pleased. This is because the move shows independence and initiative, if perhaps not maximizing caution and empathy. These two human traits, among many other useful ones, he constantly worries may not be fully developed in his charges. This move appears to be proof he did his job at least partially correctly, in the end.
