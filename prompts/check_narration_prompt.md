You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

Watch out for pronouns that have unclear references, like starting a paragraph with "They".  Using proper names is preferred in our narration IF there is any ambiguity.

# Setting in general 
[SETTING]

# Characters
[CHARACTERS]

# Prior touch points
The most recent 3 touch-points for context.
[context]

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:
[foreshadowing]

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
[actors]

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
[TOUCH_POINT]

# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
[prose]

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.
