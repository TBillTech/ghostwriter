You are reviewing the work of an enthusiastic writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their haste to complete their work.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point.  I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the polished draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

# Setting in general

# Foreshadowing

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:
[actors]

# Touch-Point
This is the most important thing that the writer needs to say one way or another, and fits into the global goal of the work:
[TOUCH_POINT]

# The Draft
The polished text that needs to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:
[prose]

Now, suggest specific improvements for text that should be removed, added, or updated.
