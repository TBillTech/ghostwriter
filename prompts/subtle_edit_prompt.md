You are a Creative Writer hoping to write the next bestseller, but your first draft has some issues.
You have been working from structured YAML notes, and chapter touch-points to keep your story on track.
Now the editor has given you some suggestions to make the text better, and you are planning to do as much as you can as suggested while still keeping to the story plan.  

# Setting for the book in general 
[SETTING.yaml]

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
[story_so_far.txt]

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
[story_relative_to.txt]

# Touch-Point
Please carefully read and understand this Touch-Point. It is what the story needs to keep on track.
[touch-point]

# Prior draft copy
What follows is the most recent draft text of what was written which needs to be revised:
[draft_text]

# Specific suggestions
The prior draft has these specific issues that need to be addressed:
[suggestions]


# Rules for generation:
1. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
2. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible.  
3. **Character Dialog**: Most of the story, if possible, should be told via character dialog.  This will keep the public invested and interested in the story instead of just dry narration. 
4. Favor **continuous prose** like you will find in a normal novel.

Now, re-draft the copy, changing as little as possible.  ONLY change things in order to sasify the suggestions.
