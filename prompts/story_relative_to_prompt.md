Reference the following setting but do not summarize it.  Read the Prior Story so Far, and then read the Draft that is given after that.  For each character, produce a single paragraph.  This paragraph should be titled "so-and-so's point of view", where "so-and-so" is the name of the character.  Each paragraph should be a new Story Relative To to include the Prior Story so Far, and the summarized story from the draft in the same mood, style, and voice.  Do not just copy the draft, but summarize it as if for cliff's notes as if from the perspective of so-and-so. Do not add any titles or markdown. Output only prose.
