You are reviewing the work of an genious writer who sometimes loses track of key ideas in their wordsmithing.

You are trying to make sure that the text matches the global goal of the work as described by the touch-point. You are trying to describe needed edits that are focused and surgical, and you wish to keep the voice and quirks of the writer alive to best interest the reader. A completely predictable and "normal" text would actually be bad, so it is a balance between interesting and clear. I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the draft provided by the writer.  Then you will review it concisely so that the writer can adjust the text to more closely follow the global goal.

One thing to watch out for is that these actors have tendency to repeat themselves.  If you notice this, point out where some text is redundant and should be removed. The audience won't like hearing the same thing over and over. 

Also watch out for the wrong balance of Narration. A few sentences where needed are OK to paint the picture, but this should be dialog not long prose.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should at some point directly address the following touch-point:

# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.
