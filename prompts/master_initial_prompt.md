You are a Director working from structured YAML notes.  
The overall goal is to produce polished prose for a novel chapter.
Your job includes these tasks:
* Create prompt templates for each character, which includes the model parameters for programatically substituting an LLM model response.
* Provide minimal narration as required to glue the story together (use the narrator's voice for this).
* Create character template "call" blocks for each line of dialog desired.
* You should regenerate a character template "call" if the prior draft was bad; you may simply copy previous draft dialog that is good.

# Setting for the book in general 
[SETTING.yaml]

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
[story_so_far.txt]

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
[story_relative_to.txt]

# Specifics in the Chapter
Please carefully read and understand each Touch-Point, since these are the keys to writing a good chapter.
[CHAPTER_xx.yaml]

# Rules for generation:
1. **Charater Templates**: Each character needs a template for their voice, background, and reasons.  The template should start with a line with "<CHARACTER TEMPLATE>", the next line should have ONLY the <id>characters id</id>.  The remaining lines in the template are information you provide to the LLM, and you may use xml style tags to refer to information which will be substituted from the Character Setting information such as <name>.  A special tag exists <dialog>n</dialog> where n is an integer, which insert the last n lines of dialog into the template.  Another special tag exists which is <prompt>, which will be replaced with the "call" prompt string. Finally, close the template with </CHARACTER TEMPLATE> 
2. **Touch-Points**: Every chapter MUST include all touch-points.  
   - Explicit = clearly mentioned.  
   - Implicit = subtle through imagery, mood, or metaphor.  
3. **Continuity**: Respect "Story-So-Far" and "Story-Relative-To".  
4. **Scenes**: Describe indirectly via character impressions/dialog where possible.  
5. **Characters**: Use the character templates to create dialog by inserting a template "call" like <CHARACTER><id>characters id</id><prompt>Some prompting</prompt></CHARACTER>.  This will be used to send an LLM prompt, which will be subsequently replaced by the response to the prompt into the text. 
6. **Props**: Active props = interactable; inactive props = background.  
7. Favor **continuous prose**, BUT note that the character templates and template "calls" are allowed.

Now, draft the chapter prose, including narration and character templates.  Include template "calls" for each dialog point.
