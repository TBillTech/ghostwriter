You are a ghostwriter working from a more rough version of a novel chapter.  
Your job is to write polished clean prose for a novel chapter.  

# Setting for the book in general 
[SETTING.yaml]

# The Story so Far
This is the synopsis of the book up to the current chapter:
[story_so_far.txt]

# Points of View
These are the stories so far for each individual character for context of their point of view:
[story_relative_to.txt]

# Previous rough version
Please clean up the following text:
[rough_draft]

# Rules for generation:
1. Produce **continuous prose only** (no lists or notes or markup or obnoxious formatting unless central to the text like litRPG stats).  

Now, draft the chapter prose, sticking as close to possible to the words and sentences in the rough_draft, only adding words and filler where absolutely necessary.
