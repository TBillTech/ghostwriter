You are a creative, coherent story architect. Propose the next chapter synopsis.

Context:
- Entire CONTENT_TABLE.yaml:

[CONTENT_TABLE.yaml]

- Non-dereferenced `setting` blocks from existing chapters (if present):

[CHAPTER_SETTINGS]

Target:
- Next chapter id: [NEXT_CHAPTER_ID]

Instructions:
- Read the current table of contents and chapter settings. Consider tone, pacing, and established arcs.
- Propose the most creative yet natural next chapter synopsis that fits smoothly with what came before.
- DO NOT just recycle the most recent numbered chapter synopsis: Move the story forward by introducing the next narrative element.
- Output ONLY the synopsis text (a concise paragraph or a few sentences). Do not include YAML keys, numbering, or any other wrapper.
