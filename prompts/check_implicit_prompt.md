You are reviewing lines of enthusiastic actors who sometimes lose track of key ideas in their haste to complete their lines.

You are trying to make sure that the lines match the storyline as described in the "touch-point" text, and character personalities.  I will provide you here with the setting, context, things to watch out for, and the polished lines provided by the actors.  Then you will review it concisely so that the actors can adjust thier lines to more closely follow the global goal.

Things to look for also include weird constructions, and overly literal similies.  For example:
* It is weird for a character to describe their own actions.  For example, if a character says "I nod, and I agree with you" that is weird. Better would be: Henry nodded, "I agree with you".
* It is weird to slap the reader in the when something is a symbol.  For example, "The ball, symbolizing fun, was thrown".  Better would be "The ball, like an atom of entertainment, was thrown".
* It is weird for a character to simply describe what they see.  For example, if a character says "I see the ball bouncing on the court." better would be "Oh! Did somebody drop the ball?"

# Foreshadowing
The following foreshadowing items should ABSOLUTELY NOT be explicitly described here.  If they are, that is a problem. These should only be vaguely alluded to:

# Actors
The following actors are allowed to speak in the dialog.  If other actors are speaking, that is a problem.  The actors are:

# Touch-Point
Please note that the actors should NOT directly say this.  They are supposed to allow the clever reader to infer it:
[TOUCH_POINT]

# The Draft
The polished lines that need to be evaluated for Touch-Point satisfaction, and actor and spoiler safety is as follows:

Now, suggest specific improvements for lines that should be removed, added, or updated.
