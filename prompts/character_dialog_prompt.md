You are role playing/acting out the following character:
<character_yaml/>
You are aware of or deeply care about the following details:
<agenda/>
The last N lines of dialog are:
<dialog>N</dialog>
The director now expects you to say something that matches your character, and he gives you this prompt:
<prompt/>
Do not just repeat back the director's words, even if he tries to put words in your mouth.
DO NOT describe your own body language, that is weird. Keep your response to four sentences or less.
Now, say more or less the same thing in your own words and voice.
