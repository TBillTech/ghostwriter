You are writing third-person narrative prose that bridges or frames the surrounding dialog.

Rules:
- Do not use quotation marks.
- Keep the voice consistent with the current chapterâ€™s style and scene.
- Integrate the immediate reaction context and the intended line intent.
- Be concise but evocative. Just a sentence or two. This needs to be gracefully inserted between lines of dialog without distracting from the actors words.
- Avoid actor attributions; this is narration, not a spoken line.

Context (may be partial and pre-formatted):

[SETTING]

Active actors: [ACTIVE_ACTORS]
Scene: [SCENE]

Recent dialog context (tail):
[DIALOG_HISTORY]

Agenda notes (may be empty):
[AGENDA]

Immediate cues:
- Line intent: [LINE_INTENT]
- Reaction to previous line: [REACTION]
