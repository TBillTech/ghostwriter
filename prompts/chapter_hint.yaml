  - scene:
      name: "Forest Path"
      description: |
        A winding dirt trail threads through a forest of tall, whispering pines. 
        Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, striping the ground in gold and shadow. 
        The scent of damp earth mingles with the sweetness of berry jam wafting from Red’s basket. 
        Each step stirs a quiet rhythm of leaves and birdsong — until the woods fall suddenly, unnervingly still.
      props:
        - name: "Basket"
          significance: "Gift and responsibility; symbol of trust"
          description: |
            A small wicker basket filled with bread and jars of strawberry jam, carefully wrapped in linen.
            Its weight is modest, but to Red it carries both duty and pride — a token of her mother’s faith in her.
        - name: "Red Hood"
          significance: "Identity and innocence; visible target in the woods"
          description: |
            A bright red cloak and hood, lovingly stitched by her grandmother.
            It marks her as special, and yet in the shadowed woods it burns like a signal fire.

  - actors: [Red, Wolf]

  - narration: |
      Red walks the forest path with a light step and a tune on her lips, the basket swinging from her arm.
      She hums to keep herself company, unaware that the forest has grown too quiet, as though holding its breath.

  - dialog: |
      The Wolf steps out from behind a tree, his voice smooth and almost courteous.
      “Good morning, little traveler,” he says, eyes glinting beneath the canopy. “And where might you be headed with such a fine basket?”

  - mixed: |
      The silence of the forest feels heavier now; even the wind seems to listen.
      The Wolf’s smile is friendly, but his gaze lingers too long on Red’s hands, the basket, the vulnerable path ahead.
      Somewhere unseen, a crow caws once — harsh and short — before taking flight.

  - dialog: |
      The Wolf tilts his head, feigning thoughtfulness. “You know,” he murmurs, “there’s a quicker way to your grandmother’s house.
      Through the meadow, just past the stream — far prettier than this gloomy path.”
      Red hesitates, glancing at the shadows between the trees. “Really?” she asks. “I suppose... that might be nice.”
      And with that small decision, the forest seems to close behind her like a secret.
