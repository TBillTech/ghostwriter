* Arthur: Just think: Eighteen means we can move out just because we WANT to!
* Misty: The professor gave us a gold merit for initiative; I’m spending it at the gate.
* Arthur takes one slow breath: I might’ve gotten carried away—thank you for coming anyway. A party within the Crèche is institutional; a quest with one friend seems… special.
* Misty: Carried away? You’re practically levitating. Don’t get mushy, pal. We’re late for our first bad decision in the city. Case open.
* Arthur: The clock says ten minutes; if we stay for cake, we have to reschedule.
* Misty: Ten thousand birthdays, one exit; I’ll take the exit, pal.
* Arthur: Hmmm.  Just how many candles can you put on one cake? 
* Misty: Let's see ... by my count, they will have to attempt, 179,968!  Misty says something dry and witty about the fire hazard. 
* Arthur reads his wrist comm: AURA says, “Group celebration begins in twelve minutes.” He quietly mutes it.
* Misty tilts her head: Tell the ubiquitous chaperone we’ve got a previous engagement—with our lives.
* Arthur quotes softly: PROF said, “Independence plus care is a sound vector.” He sounded pleased.
* Misty: Translation—go, but don’t get rolled. I like his style better than the sermon from our brighly colored furry nursemaid.
* Arthur as if looking 1 million miles away, shields his eyes: UBI covers the room in New Philadelphia. The entry points to most places in Zenith are within walking distance.
* Misty: Entry points into Zenith Lobby huh? I’ve seen feeds of that lobby. Looks like our streets wearing someone else’s face. Gives me the jitters.
* Arthur’s smile tightens: We can handle it. Clear goals help. First goal: check in, log in, no penalties.
* Misty: Second goal—keep your pranks under the legal dose. We’re new in town; let’s not start a riot.
* Arthur glances toward the towers: We can always come back for a visit, right?
* Misty: Sure, if the city doesn’t steal our hearts first. Or our shoes.
* Arthur squeezes the pocket device again: Funds are ready. My small celebration’s a big login.
* Misty: My present to myself? Answers. If Zenith’s crooked, I want the bend.
* Arthur: May I ask for clarification? On “crooked”?
* Misty: Off. Like a smile that doesn’t reach the eyes. I’ll sniff it. You swing a sword at anything that bites.
* Arthur, with a small bow: As you wish, my lady.
* Misty rolls her eyes, smiling: Keep that up and I’ll make you slay the dragons all by yourself!
