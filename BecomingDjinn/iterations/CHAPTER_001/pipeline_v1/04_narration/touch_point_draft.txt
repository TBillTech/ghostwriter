The 73rd Crèche had always felt strange, even by 2222 standards: a colony of identical-aged bodies and a hundred different artificial voices, children who had been literally birthed by machines and raised by patient circuitry. Arthur and Misty had lived exactly eighteen years—down to the hour—and that precision sat on them like a promise. CBHMA-linked achievements unlocked at eighteen; what better reason, Arthur thought, to step off the only map he had ever known and into something that might hand him a name?

Most of Cohort 73 slept until after ten, but Arthur and Misty were two of the few awake before the sun had climbed high enough to soften the glass towers’ glare. Few other teenagers paced the loading bays; most activity lived in the central yard, where half the acreage thumped with soccer, pools, and archery lanes and the other half lay quiet, trees and benches threaded like thought through muscle. Midmorning light threw the towers’ mirrored glass into long lattice shadows across the two-hundred-acre yard, a pattern that looked, from ground level, like an integrated circuit folded across green. Futuristic hovercraft hummed along the paths at the Crèche’s regulated twenty miles per hour, ferrying children and luggage everywhere the campus could imagine. A bright synthetic banner fluttered above the curved path—Cohort 73 — Dream, Build, Explore—and the chrome facades doubled the words and the moving figures on the lawns, making stillness feel heavier. AURA’s many android voices carried like distant family murmurs; the midmorning chime rolled over games and classes and made Arthur feel, without quite knowing why, like it was time to move.

Arthur and Misty stood beside a sleek silver Crèche Car with its cargo compartment already full. A pickup clock over the bay read "Departures: Arthur, Misty" and ticked down the last minutes. Arthur’s trunk looked like medieval baggage, brass corners catching the sun; Misty’s case matched a mid-twentieth-century airline aesthetic, neat straps and a smooth shell. The vehicle’s display showed a route to the perimeter access point where external ground transport would meet them—the Crèche Car could not cross the gate—and Arthur’s fingers smoothed the small preprogrammed device in his pocket as if sealing the next world shut.
