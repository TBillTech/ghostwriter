* There is no way that of 10,000 teenagers, guided by no more than AI training, more than a small number would wake before 10 am. But Arthur and Misty seem to be two of these few.
* In fact, the Crèche is a strange place by most standards, even in the year 2222: almost a colony of identical aged individuals, with only artificial personalties from any other chronological origin.
* Arthur and Misty, our heroes for this adventure are ready to leave the place they grew up: at this minute, they have both lived _exactly_ 18 years.
* Such precision in birthday might seems suprising to most, but these kids were literally birthed by machines, and raised by them. So: precision in everything, you might say.
* Midmorning light sets the 73rd Crèche’s glass towers in long lattice shadows across the 200-acre central yard. Long lattice shadows from glass towers cross the 200-acre expanse, drawing a pattern that resembles an integrated circuit at ground level.
* The yard is split between active fields and lanes—soccer, swimming, archery—and quiet lawns and trees.
* The midmorning chime sounds, turning over games, classes, and meals for those staying behind. This time, it makes Arthur feel like he needs to get moving, but where? The future probably.
* Futuristic hovercraft hum along paths, ferrying Crèche kids and equipment, literally going _everywhere_. They don't go faster than 20 miles perhour, but within the Crèche they go pretty far. No, it is unlikely most kids raised by AI will get that reference.
* A bright synthetic banner above the path reads: Cohort 73 — Dream, Build, Explore. Definitely something an AI decided to put up.
* Arthur and Misty stand at a loading bay beside a sleek silver Crèche Car with its cargo compartment already filled.
* The vehicle’s display shows a route to a perimeter access point where external ground transport will meet them. Naturally. Arthur isn't the type to _not_ program a device in advance.
* AURA’s voice, via the many, many copies of her android, carry faintly across in the complex.  From a distance they seem like murmurings of somebody else's family.
* Eligibility for CBHMA-linked Achievements begins for them today at age eighteen. What better reason for an 18 year old to strike out on their own?
* The Crèche Car cannot leave the complex; it will deliver them to the designated perimeter gate for handoff to city transport.
* The towers’ mirrored glass reflects the banner text and the moving figures on the lawns, doubling the scene in motion. Yes, in spite of the motion, the ones who stand still, for the moment, are the ones who will go the farthest.
* A pickup clock in the loading bay, titled "Departures: Arthur, Misty" counts down minutes to transfer.
* Few other teenagers are present at the loading bays at this hour; most activities continue in the central yard.
* The central yard is divided into active zones—soccer fields, pools, archery lanes—and quiet lawns threaded with trees and benches.
* Arthur’s trunk is styled like medieval baggage hardware, brass corners catching the sun.
* Misty’s luggage matches mid-20th-century airline aesthetics, smooth shells and neat straps stacked for quick retrieval.
