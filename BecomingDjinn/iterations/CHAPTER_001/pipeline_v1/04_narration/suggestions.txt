- Open on Arthur and Misty at the departure bay (move or rewrite the first paragraph). Begin with a tight present-moment image of them by the Crèche Car to increase immediacy and emphasize "first time leaving."

- Add one short beat of physical sensation for each character (e.g., Arthur’s palms damp, Misty’s jaw tight) to convey nervousness/excitement and anchor emotional stakes in the calm before action.

- Clarify the stakes of turning eighteen in one short line: specify what CBHMA achievements actually unlock (example: names/titles, equipment, access beyond the Crèche) so the reader understands why they’re leaving now.

- Replace vague/ambiguous nouns: change “trunk” to “his travel trunk” or “his case” so the object’s ownership and setting are clear.

- Rename “the small preprogrammed device” to a concrete term (e.g., “exit pass” or “gate key”) or briefly describe its function so the reader knows what Arthur is smoothing.

- Rework the sentence “that precision sat on them like a promise” to be more specific (e.g., “that precision felt like a deadline and a permission all at once”) to better reflect internal tension.

- Tighten/trim the long lobby/world-building sentence early on. Cut one metaphor (either “integrated circuit folded across green” or “like thought through muscle”) to avoid clutter and keep focus on Arthur and Misty.

- Change “AURA’s many android voices carried like distant family murmurs” to a clearer sensory image (e.g., “AURA’s announcements threaded through the yard like distant family murmurs”) to avoid passive phrasing.

- Fix the mildly unclear clause “made Arthur feel, without quite knowing why, like it was time to move.” Make it active and specific (e.g., “Arthur felt, without exactly knowing why, that the chime had set the day’s decision into motion”).

- Add a single, short exchange or private line of thought between Arthur and Misty (one or two sentences) to give them distinct voices and underline the quiet before leaving (keep it subdued—no action).

- Remove or rework “in 2222 standards” (awkward phrasing). Replace with “even for 2222” or omit.

- Check pronoun chains for clarity one more time (e.g., “making stillness feel heavier” — ensure the subject that “made” is clearly the banner/chrome reflections) and adjust if any lingering ambiguity remains.
