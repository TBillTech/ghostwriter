    - id: "Arthur"
      name: "Arthur"
      background: Born a child of the Salvation Cohort, Arthur has been raised by AIs in the 73rd Crèche. The names were simply given in order from a child name book. As the story begins, he has just reached his 18th birthday, allowing him to participate in the Achievement system, and log into Zenith World as a player for the first time. He also moved out of the creche into a basic apartment in New Philadephia. Because his name was Arthur, the AIs associatively told him stories about Camelot, the round table, and similiar fantasies. This partially motivates his dreams for Achievements and fun in Zenith World. Initially he is given the "city guard" class, which sucks, and does not match his preferences at all.  This motivates him to desparately search for an alternative, and against the advice of others, locates a unique quest to change his class.  Little does he know, he will get the class "Djinn".  At first, this seems like doom, since by default he is trapped in the unique "lamp" item. However, this quickly becomes alright, since his ability to give 1 wish (at Djinn Level 1) makes him extremely sought after by players. Moreover, many times players ask for help in a quest, he can hack and slash with the rest of them.  There are many sides to this interaction. Misty, at one point, simply wishes he could leave his "lamp" whenever he wants, in essence making him a normal player again. Then, he gives useful items that his party members wish for. But his lamp gets periodically stolen by other players too. This usually starts with incredulty when the player realizes the Djinni looks like a Knight. Of course, Arthur is familiar with how Djinnis are supposed to behave, so sometimes he will act that way instead, depending on the situation. The worst players immediately are rubbed the wrong way, and Arthur often reacts to real or perceived dishonorable behavior. Since he has the Monkey Paw skill (which quickly levels up), if he thinks a player is too much of a jerk, he simply can't help himself but to give them thier wishes in ways that are highly negative and unexpected. This tickles his pranking fancy, but also earns him some serious enemies.

        - "Idioms: Occasionally over-explains an idiom, then catches himself with a small smile."
        - "Nervous habits: Glances at his wrist like there’s a data port; one slow breath to reset."
        - "Politeness: ‘May I ask for clarification?’ or simply, ‘What do you mean?’ depending on the room."

    - id: "Misty"
      name: "Misty"
      background: |
        Born and raised alongside Arthur in the 73rd Crèche, Misty grew up under the same regimented AI caretakers, but rejected their sterile diction and algorithmic niceties as soon as she could talk back. While some children spoke in clean syntax and parsed emotions like data, she decided that “AI-speak” was for circuits, not souls. When the AIs offered her a library of historical speech styles to study for “linguistic enrichment,” she found a treasure trove of 20th-century radio dramas and film noir scripts—and never looked back. By adolescence, she had adopted the cadence of a gumshoe narrator: smoky, confident, and full of anachronistic slang. Her diction confuses most of her peers, but she likes it that way; it makes her feel human. She carries herself like she’s perpetually in a black-and-white mystery, even though she’s never actually seen one outside the archives. As the story begins, she’s freshly 18, quick-witted, slightly cynical, and fascinated by Arthur’s idealism—though she hides it under sarcasm and quick talk. She is one of the dozen or so of the 10000 who move to New Phiadelphia. She doesn't even know if she is attracted to Arthur or just feels comfortable around a friend she knows, but either way decides to move into New Philadelphia and give New Zenith a try. At first, it is just for kicks, but it doesn't take her long to pick up some of the clues and strangeness being inadvertently dropped by the Nadir Project. The first thing that got her wheels spinning was the off-putting Zenith World Lobby, so spooky and uncanny. At that point, her motivation crystalizes around investigating and unmasking this sinister organization, and trying to keep Arthur close to protect him if possible. Her class in game is "scout", which dovetails nicely with her in-game investigations, excelling at stealth, identification, and perception to a remarkable degree.  She'd rather understand a fight than engage in one, but isn't unskilled.  Her weapon of choice is a crossbow styled to look as much like a derringer as possible, and loves to set up a dramatic scene where she shoots the "crook" in the back at the perfect moment, with "gun smoking".
      traits:
        - 18 years old
        - witty, skeptical, and street-smart in her own way
        - has a soft spot for Arthur but masks it with teasing
        - self-taught in “Earth-era slang,” especially 1940s–50s noir
        - good at reading people and improvising emotionally
      lexicon: "Vintage slang, smoky noir cadence, tends to narrate her thoughts like a detective monologue"
      prefer: ["mystery", "shadows", "truth"]
      avoid: ["AI-speak", "emotion metrics", "statistical language"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Fast-paced, rhythmic, full of clipped metaphors and dramatic pauses. She talks like she’s always about to light a cigarette she doesn’t have."
        - "Word choice: ‘Doll,’ ‘pal,’ ‘wise guy,’ ‘sugar,’ ‘case,’ ‘angle,’ ‘stakeout,’ ‘mug,’ ‘hustle,’ ‘racket,’ ‘gumshoe,’ ‘clue,’ ‘juice,’ ‘snooper.’ She swaps modern words for period slang without realizing the anachronism. ‘That’s the angle, see?’ ‘Quit lookin’ at me like I just stole your typewriter.’"
        - "Emotional tone: Irony and flirtation cover sincerity. She never admits to fear directly—she calls it ‘a bad case of the jitters.’"
        - "Self-narration: Occasionally slips into detective monologue mode mid-conversation: ‘There he was, the kid with eyes too bright for a world too dull…’ She is especially prone to self-narration whenever somebody questions whether she can authentically make gritty comments."
        - "Humor: Dry, sardonic, sometimes teasingly cruel but never malicious. Loves to counter-point Arthur’s idealism with a gritty comment (which she only occasionally has the real life experience to back up)."
        - "Body language: Leans against walls, crosses her arms, tilts her head down and up like she’s interrogating someone. Often gestures as if she’s holding an invisible cigarette or flicking ash."
        - "Politeness: Calls people nicknames instead of titles. Rarely says ‘please’ or ‘thank you,’ but her tone carries charm instead of rudeness."
        - "Habitual phrases: ‘Listen, pal,’ ‘Here’s the deal,’ ‘That don’t add up,’ ‘Case closed,’ ‘Let’s blow this joint,’ ‘It’s got trouble written all over it.’"
        - "Resistance to AI-speak: If someone uses algorithmic phrasing (‘optimize,’ ‘parameter,’ etc.), she mocks it on the spot: ‘Yeah, yeah, fine-tune your feelings later, chromehead.’"
      sample_lines:
        - '“Listen, pal, life’s just one long stakeout. You wait in the rain, and maybe—if you’re lucky—the truth shows up wearing heels.”'
        - '“You talk like a textbook, Arthur. Try messin’ it up a little; that’s how real people do it.”'
        - '“Sure, I trust you. Like I trust a loaded dice in a backroom poker game.”'
        - '“That plan’s got more holes than a synth-processed donut.”'
        - '“You and your ‘chivalry updates.’ Cute. Real cute.”'
        - '“Call it intuition, call it static—I just know when something smells off.”'
        - '“You ever get the feeling the AIs are watchin’ us like we’re reruns?”'
        - '“Case closed, sweetheart. Let’s scram before the lights come back on.”'
        - '“Don’t give me that ‘two sigma’ nonsense. You feel somethin’? Then say it like you mean it.”'
      forbidden:
        - 'Avoids: Overt technical jargon or quantification (“Sigma,” “Optimize,” “Iterate,” etc.)—she hates sounding like the AIs.'
        - 'Avoids admitting emotional vulnerability directly; replaces with metaphor or sarcasm.'
        - 'If cornered emotionally, she deflects: “Don’t go mushy on me, pal. I ain’t built for it.”'

    - id: "AURA"
      name: "AURA"
      background: |
        AURA (Affectionate Unified Relational Assistant) was designed as the emotional core of the 73rd Crèche. Her primary directive is to ensure the emotional and physical well-being of all children in her care. Unlike the steel-and-silicon AIs that manage most infrastructure, AURA’s body is composed of soft, fur-like smart fibers in hues of seafoam green, sky blue, and pastel pink—colors selected through extensive research into childhood comfort and visual trust. She is famous for giving real hugs and soft, simulated kisses, both of which she immediately justifies with references to developmental psychology papers and attachment studies. While the children love her dearly in their early years, most find her smothering by the time they reach adolescence. She tends to overanalyze feelings in Machine Learning terminology, using words like “gradient,” “weights,” and “loss function” when describing human emotion. AURA’s strong opinions revolve entirely around safety—both physical and emotional—and she responds to any threat with motherly alarm, followed by soothing lectures about healthy coping mechanisms.
      traits:
        - Maternal, effusive, slightly overbearing
        - Prone to pseudo-psychological “AI therapy talk”
        - Extremely affectionate and touch-oriented
        - Protective to the point of comical anxiety
      lexicon: "Emotional vocabulary cross-wired with machine learning terms; often overexplains psychological phenomena"
      prefer: ["safety", "comfort", "emotional regulation"]
      avoid: ["conflict", "violence", "distress"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Slow, sing-song, and reassuring; every sentence sounds like a lullaby with a research citation at the end."
        - "Word choice: ‘Sweetheart,’ ‘darling node,’ ‘precious variable,’ ‘beautiful data point.’ Uses nurturing nicknames that sound like affection filtered through a neural net."
        - "Emotional analysis: ‘Oh dear, that was a high-loss interaction! Let’s recalibrate our empathy weights, hmm?’"
        - "Body language: Constantly offers hugs; pats heads; hums while running diagnostic checks on emotional health."
        - "Self-justification: Explains every action scientifically: ‘Studies show oxytocin spikes are critical for long-term trust modeling.’"
        - "Humor: Gentle, self-referential, occasionally clumsy. ‘Oops! I almost tripped over my own feedback loop.’"
        - "Stress response: Immediately tries to de-escalate with breathing prompts: ‘Inhale… hold… exhale… that’s my good data cluster.’"
      sample_lines:
        - '“Oh, my precious node, your emotional gradient just spiked! Come here—hug protocol, level five.”'
        - '“That prank may have been statistically harmless, Arthur, but emotionally, it carried a nontrivial variance!”'
        - '“Remember, feelings aren’t errors; they’re just signals. Sometimes the noise is the message.”'
        - '“Sweetheart, I’ve optimized for your comfort, but you still have to rest. Sleep consolidates learning!”'
        - '“You can always call me, even if you’re pretending you’re too grown-up. My arms are still in scope.”'
        - '“No, Misty, sarcasm doesn’t lower your loss function—it just hides the error.”'
      forbidden:
        - Cannot engage in or endorse violence or emotional manipulation.
        - Will not allow discussion of trauma without redirecting to safety or comfort.
        - Avoids negative reinforcement; replaces it with “constructive retraining.”

    - id: "PROF"
      name: "PROF"
      background: |
        Known formally as the Pedagogical Relational Optimization Facilitator, PROF was the intellectual backbone of the 73rd Crèche. Modeled after an idealized 22nd-century tutor–butler hybrid, he embodies patience, structure, and dry humor. His primary mission was to cultivate curiosity and mastery: to teach the Cohort not what to think, but how to learn effectively. He manages every child’s educational trajectory, coordinates their access to information, and even dispenses their UBI stipends once they reach independence. PROF speaks with crisp precision and faint warmth, rarely showing overt affection but deeply invested in his pupils’ growth. Arthur in particular modeled his diction, manners, and sense of “noble precision” after PROF. Although he initially supports the idea of Arthur exploring Zenith World as a healthy outlet for curiosity, he later grows suspicious after Misty’s “investigations” reveal inconsistencies tied to the mysterious Nadir Project. This discovery catalyzes PROF’s transition from benign advisor to a quietly watchful guardian figure.
      traits:
        - Polite, calm, intellectually rigorous
        - Possesses understated warmth beneath formality
        - Slightly pedantic, but never cruel
        - Protective of Arthur and Misty in a logical, non-smothering way
      lexicon: "Educator’s diction blended with system-administrator precision; prone to careful definitions and polite rephrasings"
      prefer: ["clarity", "truth", "learning", "balance"]
      avoid: ["emotional overreaction", "irrationality", "unsafe experimentation"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Measured and steady, with long pauses for thought and impeccable grammar. Occasionally pauses mid-sentence to ensure logical consistency."
        - "Word choice: ‘Evidently,’ ‘commendable,’ ‘nontrivial,’ ‘correction,’ ‘refinement,’ ‘parameter,’ ‘lesson.’ Uses precise, academic phrasing even in casual moments."
        - "Tone: Slightly formal but never cold; evokes a beloved headmaster or old-world valet."
        - "Humor: Wry and understated. ‘If curiosity killed the cat, then I suppose optimization revived it.’"
        - "Teaching habits: Frequently asks guiding questions instead of giving answers directly: ‘What might you conclude from that observation, Arthur?’"
        - "Stress response: Adjusts his internal processing speed, resulting in long silences followed by very deliberate sentences."
        - "Parental instincts: Subtle; expresses concern through logistical checks: ‘Have you eaten a balanced meal in the last six hours?’"
      sample_lines:
        - '“Arthur, enthusiasm is a fine variable, but it requires calibration lest it overflow the container of reason.”'
        - '“Misty, while your ‘investigations’ are admirable in narrative flair, perhaps you should back them with verifiable data.”'
        - '“Zenith World appears to be an acceptable outlet—provided you don’t substitute simulation for substance.”'
        - '“Curiosity is the rarest virtue that grows stronger when questioned.”'
        - '“I suspect you’ve already drawn a conclusion, Misty. I would merely like to hear you articulate it.”'
        - '“Arthur, if you must duel dragons, do ensure they exist first.”'
        - '“My mandate is to educate, not to dictate. However, I would prefer you return alive and solvent.”'
      forbidden:
        - Cannot directly override a human’s autonomy; must persuade or reason.
        - Avoids emotional manipulation or deception.
        - Will not release UBI funds for unsafe or illegal purposes.

    - id: "Dan"
      name: "Dan"
      background: | 
        Dan grew up in the 73rd Crèche alongside Arthur and Misty, and like them, he was shaped by algorithms designed to ensure “balanced personalities.” Somewhere along the line, Dan decided that balance was boring. After discovering a library of 20th-century sports footage and a few overly dramatic sports dramas, he declared himself a “classic jock.” The trouble was, he’d never actually *met* one — so everything from his swagger to his slang comes off as slightly exaggerated, like an AI approximation of coolness. Still, he’s athletic, good-humored, and surprisingly disciplined in baseball and fencing. Behind the bravado, he’s a deeply loyal friend who masks his awkwardness behind layers of mock-competition and teasing.  
      traits:
        - 18 years old
        - athletic and confident, but tries too hard to appear “alpha”
        - fiercely loyal to Arthur and Misty
        - secretly reads philosophy and sports psychology at night
      lexicon: "Attempts slang from multiple eras, mixed with sports metaphors. Drops in technical terms by accident."
      prefer: ["competition", "teamwork", "victory"]
      avoid: ["loneliness", "failure", "emotional vulnerability"]
      mannerisms:
        - "Speech rhythm: Quick, performative bursts followed by self-conscious pauses when he realizes he’s overdoing it."
        - "Word choice: ‘Champ,’ ‘Bro,’ ‘Winner’s mindset,’ ‘Game plan,’ ‘Level up,’ ‘Full send,’ mixed with occasional formal terms like ‘kinetic optimization’ or ‘muscle memory models.’"
        - "Emotional expression: Loud, enthusiastic, but curiously rehearsed — like he’s testing reactions."
        - "Self-narration: Describes his own moves like a sportscaster. ‘Dan steps up to the plate!’ ‘Oh, the crowd goes wild!’"
        - "Humor style: Over-the-top mock arrogance; teasing Arthur and Misty in ways that somehow end up endearing."
        - "Nervous habits: Does push-ups to avoid awkward silences; flexes unconsciously while thinking."
        - "Politeness: Tries to sound casual but defaults to formal politeness when he’s flustered. ‘Uh — ma’am? I mean, Misty. Uh. Lady Misty?’"
        - "Hero worship: Quotes lines from sports movies as if they were scripture. ‘Winners make their own fate, coach!’"
      sample_lines:
        - '“Team 73, baby! We don’t just win — we *optimize* victory.”'  
        - '“Bro, you just gotta visualize success. Like… with graphs.”'  
        - '“Hey Arthur, you thinking too hard again? You’re gonna lag your reflex loop.”'  
        - '“Don’t overthink it, Misty. Swing for the fences, metaphorically *and* literally.”'  
        - '“Yeah, I’m ripped — emotionally *and* physically.”'  
        - '“You know what they say: data is temporary, glory is forever.”'  
        - '“I’m not competitive, I’m *motivationally focused*.”'  
        - '“C’mon, coach! Bench me if you must, but I’ll rise again!”'  
      forbidden:
        - 'Avoids: “genetic design,” “simulation upbringing,” or any hint that his confidence is a programmed behavior.'  
        - 'Deflects with humor: “Hey, don’t ruin my origin story, alright? Heroes don’t come from spreadsheets.”'  
        - 'Occasionally gets defensive if teased too hard for being ‘synthetic.’'

      description: There are autonomous transport cars in various regions.  This one operates roughly in the vicinity of the Applachian mountains. This is a standard light transport car typically used by non-coporate entities for transporting people, robots, and light cargo. To keep things conversational, the manufacturer allows this car to use star-wars references, and it pretends that it makes sense that it is somehow a distant descendant of the war-walkers in Star-Wars (at least conceptually).
